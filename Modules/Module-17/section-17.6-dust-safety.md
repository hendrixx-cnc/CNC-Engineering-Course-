# 17.6 Dust and Fume Control Systems

## Why Advanced Materials Require Special Dust Control

### Health Hazards of Composite and Ceramic Dust

**Carbon Fiber Dust**:
- Particle size: 5-10 μm (respirable, reaches deep lungs)
- IARC classification: Group 2B (possibly carcinogenic)
- Fiber geometry: Length >>diameter (similar to asbestos concern)
- Irritant: Skin, eyes, respiratory tract
- Conductivity: Can cause electrical shorts in equipment

**Glass Fiber (GFRP)**:
- Acute: Skin irritation ("itching"), eye irritation
- Chronic: Possible lung scarring (fibrosis)
- Diameter: 5-15 μm fibers respirable
- Less hazardous than carbon fiber but still significant

**Ceramic Dust**:
- **Crystalline silica**: Silicosis (progressive, incurable lung disease)
  - Latency: 10-30 years from exposure to symptoms
  - OSHA PEL: 0.05 mg/m³ (very low permissible exposure)
- **Aluminum oxide**: Respiratory irritant, possible lung disease
- **Zirconia**: Metal fume when laser cutting (inhalation hazard)

**Resin Systems** (composites):
- **Epoxy dust**: Sensitizer (allergic reactions develop over time)
- **Phenolic**: Formaldehyde release during cutting
- **Polyester**: Styrene fumes (VOCs)

### Equipment Contamination

**Carbon Fiber Conductivity**:
- Fine carbon dust is electrically conductive
- Can short circuit electronics (CNC controllers, drives)
- Accumulation on spindle = bearing failure
- Static discharge risk (explosion in high concentration)

**Abrasive Wear**:
- Ceramic dust extremely hard (alumina 9 on Mohs scale)
- Accelerates wear on machine ways, ballscrews, bearings
- Contaminates lubricants → grinding paste effect
- Spindle seals critical to protect bearings

**Cost of Poor Dust Control**:
- Machine rebuild: $5,000-50,000
- Spindle replacement: $2,000-20,000
- Lost productivity during repairs
- Health claims (workers' compensation)

## Dust Collection System Design

### Capture Methods

**Downdraft Table**: Air drawn down through perforated surface
- Face velocity: 100-150 FPM minimum
- Captures dust before becoming airborne
- Large CFM requirements (500-5000+ CFM)

**Spindle Shroud/Hood**: Surrounds cutting tool
- Lower CFM (50-200 CFM typical)
- Very effective (close to source)
- Can combine with downdraft

**Full Enclosure**: Machine fully enclosed
- Negative pressure containment
- Best contamination control
- More expensive, less access

### Filter Selection

**HEPA Filters Required**:
- 99.97% efficiency at 0.3 μm
- Mandatory for carbon fiber, silica dust
- Cartridge filters with pulse cleaning

**Wet Collection**:
- Water scrubs dust from air
- Good for fine particles
- Sludge disposal required
- Higher maintenance

## Personal Protective Equipment

**Respiratory Protection**:
- P100 half-mask minimum for production work
- PAPR for comfort during extended use
- N95 inadequate for carbon fiber/ceramic grinding

**Skin Protection**:
- Gloves (nitrile)
- Long sleeves (fiber protection)
- Disposable coveralls (Tyvek) for heavy exposure

**Eye Protection**:
- Safety glasses with side shields (minimum)
- Face shield for visible dust clouds

## Machine Protection

**Spindle Sealing**:
- Positive pressure purge air system
- Prevents dust entering bearings
- Critical for equipment longevity

**Way Covers**:
- Bellows protect linear guides
- Wipers remove dust from ways
- Essential for abrasive materials

**Electronics Protection**:
- Sealed control cabinets
- Positive pressure with filtered air
- Prevents carbon fiber shorts

## Maintenance and Housekeeping

**Daily**:
- HEPA vacuum machine surfaces (never blow with air)
- Empty dust collector hopper
- Damp wipe control surfaces

**Weekly**:
- Check filter pressure drop
- Inspect capture hoods for blockage

**Monthly**:
- Deep clean machine internals
- Inspect spindle seals

**Annually**:
- Replace filter cartridges
- Air sampling (exposure monitoring)
- Blower maintenance

## Regulatory Compliance

**OSHA Standards**:
- Silica standard (29 CFR 1910.1053) for ceramics
- Respiratory protection program required
- Exposure monitoring and recordkeeping

**Exposure Limits (8-hour TWA)**:
- Crystalline silica: 0.05 mg/m³
- Carbon fiber: 5 mg/m³ (NIOSH recommendation)
- Aluminum oxide: 5 mg/m³ (respirable)

## Cost Analysis

**Small Shop System**: $3,000-9,000
- Downdraft table, blower, filters
- Installation and ductwork

**Operating Cost**: $2,800-4,000/year
- Electricity, filters, maintenance

**Cost of Not Having System**:
- Spindle failure: $2,000-20,000
- Health claims: $50,000-500,000+
- OSHA fines: $15,000+ per violation

## Summary

Dust control is mandatory for advanced materials machining:
- Health hazards: Carbon fiber (carcinogen), silica (silicosis), glass fiber (irritant)
- Equipment protection: Fine dust destroys bearings, shorts electronics
- System requirements: HEPA filtration, proper capture velocity, maintenance
- PPE: P100 respirator minimum for production work
- Compliance: OSHA silica standard, respiratory protection program
