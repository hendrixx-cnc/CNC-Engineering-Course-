# Module 24 – L.E.A.N. Strategies for CNC Manufacturing


## 24.10.1 The Kaizen Philosophy

**Kaizen** (Japanese: 改善) means "change for better" or "continuous improvement."

**Literal translation:**
- **Kai** (改) = change
- **Zen** (善) = good/better

### Philosophy

**Developed by Masaaki Imai**, introduced to the West in his 1986 book *Kaizen: The Key to Japan's Competitive Success.*

**Core Beliefs:**

**1. Everyone Can Contribute:**
- Not just engineers or management
- Operators know their work best
- Small ideas from many > big ideas from few

**2. Small Steps, Continuous:**
- Many small improvements daily
- Not waiting for big breakthroughs
- Compound effect enormous over time

**3. No Acceptable Status Quo:**
- Today's standard is tomorrow's improvement target
- Complacency is the enemy
- Always ask "Can we do this better?"

**4. Improvement is Everyone's Job:**
- Not separate from daily work
- Built into culture
- Daily responsibility

**5. Respect for People:**
- People want to improve
- Create environment for ideas
- Psychological safety essential

### Kaizen vs. Innovation

**Innovation (Kaikaku):**
- Large, radical changes
- Significant investment
- Top-down
- Occasional (years between)
- High risk
- Example: Buy new CNC machine ($500K)

**Kaizen:**
- Small, incremental changes
- Minimal investment
- Bottom-up
- Continuous (daily)
- Low risk
- Example: Improve tool changeover method (save 2 min)

**Both Needed:**
- Innovation: Step changes in capability
- Kaizen: Maximize value from existing resources
- **Kaizen + Innovation = Sustained Competitive Advantage**

### The Kaizen Mindset

**Traditional Thinking:**
- "If it ain't broke, don't fix it"
- "We've always done it this way"
- "Good enough"

**Kaizen Thinking:**
- "It can always be better"
- "What worked yesterday may not be best today"
- "Good today, better tomorrow, best next week"

**Quote from Masaaki Imai:**
*"The message of the Kaizen strategy is that not a day should go by without some kind of improvement being made somewhere in the company."*

## 24.10.2 Types of Kaizen

### 24.10.2.1 Point Kaizen (Quick Improvements)

**Point Kaizen:** Small improvement at single location, by individual or small team.

**Characteristics:**
- Focused on one issue
- One workstation or process
- Implemented quickly (hours to days)
- Minimal resources
- Operator-led typically

**Examples:**

**1. Tool Organization:**
- Problem: Operator walks to tool crib (50 feet away)
- Kaizen: Install shadow board at machine
- Time: 2 hours to implement
- Savings: 5 min per setup × 3 setups/day = 15 min/day

**2. Coolant Concentration:**
- Problem: Coolant concentration varies, affects tool life
- Kaizen: Daily concentration check added to operator routine, chart posted
- Time: 1 hour to create chart/procedure
- Result: Consistent concentration, 20% tool life improvement

**3. First-Off Template:**
- Problem: First-off inspection takes 15 min (measuring many dimensions)
- Kaizen: Create template for critical dimensions only
- Time: 3 hours to make template
- Savings: 15 min → 5 min per setup

**Benefits:**
- Quick wins (motivation)
- Builds improvement capability
- Minimal approval needed
- Operator ownership

### 24.10.2.2 System Kaizen (Flow Kaizen)

**System Kaizen:** Improvement of entire value stream or system.

**Characteristics:**
- Cross-functional
- Affects multiple processes
- Requires planning and resources
- Days to weeks to implement
- Typically led by management/engineering

**Examples:**

**1. Cell Implementation:**
- Change from functional layout to cellular
- Affects multiple machines, departments
- Requires equipment moves, training
- 2-4 weeks implementation
- Result: 60% lead time reduction

**2. Pull System Implementation:**
- Convert from push to pull (Kanban)
- Entire value stream affected
- Design supermarkets, calculate Kanban quantities
- 4-8 weeks implementation
- Result: 50% inventory reduction

**3. Setup Reduction Program:**
- SMED implementation across all machines
- Standardize fixtures, tool presetting
- 3-6 months phased implementation
- Result: Average setup time 90 min → 10 min

**Benefits:**
- Major improvements (breakthrough results)
- System optimization (not local)
- Strategic alignment

### 24.10.2.3 Plane Kaizen (Innovation)

**Plane Kaizen:** Radical improvement, often technology-enabled.

**Characteristics:**
- Major change in capability
- Significant investment
- Long implementation (months to years)
- Management-led
- Strategic decision

**Examples:**

**1. Automation:**
- Install robotic loading system
- Capital investment: $250K
- 12 months implementation
- Result: Lights-out production capability

**2. New Technology:**
- Replace conventional machines with 5-axis CNC
- Investment: $500K
- Result: Reduce operations from 4 to 1

**3. Facility Expansion:**
- Build new facility with Lean design
- Investment: $5M
- Result: 2× capacity, modern layout

**Note:** Even with innovation, apply Kaizen to maximize value.

- Analyze root causes
- Develop countermeasures
- Set targets
- **A3 is perfect tool for Plan**

**Do:**
- Implement on small scale (pilot)
- Test the countermeasures
- Collect data
- **Learn by doing**

**Check:**
- Analyze results
- Did we achieve target?
- What worked? What didn't?
- **Data-driven evaluation**

**Act:**
- If successful: Standardize (new standard work)
- If not successful: Adjust and repeat PDCA
- Share learning
- **Capture knowledge**

### PDCA Example: Reducing CNC Scrap

**Plan (Week 1):**
- Problem: 5% scrap rate on Housing part (diameter out of tolerance)
- Root cause: Spindle thermal growth (cold start)
- Countermeasure: Implement spindle warmup routine (10-min warmup cycle before first part)
- Target: Reduce scrap to <1%

**Do (Week 2):**
- Pilot warmup routine on one machine
- Operators run warmup every morning
- Track scrap rate daily

**Check (Week 3):**
- Results: Scrap reduced to 0.5% (success!)
- Operators report warmup easy to do
- No negative impacts observed

**Act (Week 4):**
- Standardize: Update standard work to include warmup
- Rollout to all machines
- Communicate success
- **New standard: Warmup before first part**

**Next PDCA:**
- New target: Eliminate remaining 0.5% scrap
- Investigate: Why some parts still failing?

**Continuous cycle!**

### PDCA Principles

**1. Small Experiments:**
- Test changes on small scale
- Learn quickly
- Low risk

**2. Data-Driven:**
- Measure before and after
- Objective evaluation
- No opinions, just facts

**3. Iterative:**
- Multiple cycles
- Each cycle builds on previous
- Never-ending improvement

**4. Scientific Method:**
- Hypothesis (countermeasure)
- Test (Do)
- Analyze (Check)
- Conclude (Act)

**5. Learning Organization:**
- Capture what works
- Share knowledge
- Build capability

## Summary

Kaizen (continuous improvement) is a philosophy where everyone contributes small improvements daily, creating compound benefits over time. Three types exist: Point Kaizen (quick, local), System Kaizen (value stream-level), and Plane Kaizen (innovation). Kaizen Events are intense 3-5 day improvement activities by cross-functional teams, following a structured process from current state analysis to implementation and follow-up.

Daily Kaizen creates a culture where small improvements are normal, expected, and celebrated. Suggestion systems capture and implement employee ideas, while A3 problem-solving provides a structured, visual format for addressing complex issues. The PDCA cycle (Plan-Do-Check-Act) guides iterative improvement, emphasizing small experiments, data-driven decisions, and standardization of successful changes.

Kaizen is the heart of Lean culture: not just tools and techniques, but a mindset that challenges the status quo and pursues perfection through continuous, incremental improvement.

## Practical Exercise: Conduct a Mini-Kaizen Event

**Execute a 1-day mini-Kaizen event:**

**Preparation (Week Before):**
1. Identify opportunity (a problem in your CNC operation)
2. Set goal (specific, measurable)
3. Assemble team (3-5 people including operator)
4. Collect baseline data

**Event Day (8 hours):**

**Hour 1-2: Current State**
- Gemba walk
- Observe and document
- Video or time study
- Identify waste

**Hour 3-4: Analysis and Design**
- Root cause analysis (5 Whys)
- Brainstorm improvements
- Design future state
- Prioritize actions

**Hour 5-6: Implement**
- Hands-on changes
- Build, reorganize, create
- Test and refine

**Hour 7: Verify**
- Run process with changes
- Measure results
- Document new standard

**Hour 8: Report**
- Present results to stakeholders
- Before/after comparison
- Lessons learned
- Celebrate!

**Deliverables:**
- Current state documentation (photos, data)
- Future state design
- Implementation photos
- Results comparison (baseline vs. after)
- Standard work document
- A3 summarizing the event
- 30-day follow-up plan
