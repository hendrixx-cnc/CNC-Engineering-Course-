# Module 26 – CNC Business Ownership and Management


## Overview

Equipment is the heart of your CNC business and typically your largest capital investment. Making smart equipment decisions—what to buy, when to buy, new vs. used, how to finance—directly impacts profitability, capacity, and competitiveness. Poor equipment decisions can cripple a startup with excessive debt, inadequate capability, or reliability problems.

This section provides a strategic framework for equipment selection, detailed guidance on evaluating used machines, financing options comparison, ROI analysis methods, and advice on delivery, installation, and service contracts.

## 7.1 Equipment Selection Strategy

### 7.1.1 New vs. Used Machines

**The Single Most Important Equipment Decision**

**Used Machines:**

**Advantages:**
- ✓ **Cost Savings: 40-70% less** than new (2015 machine often 50% of new price)
- ✓ Immediate availability (no 6-12 month lead times)
- ✓ Proven technology (bugs worked out)
- ✓ Lower depreciation (already depreciated significantly)
- ✓ More machine for the money (can afford larger/better used vs. smaller new)
- ✓ Known reliability (can research specific serial number history)

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ Wear and unknown history (hours, maintenance, crashes)
- ✗ Older control technology (may be harder to program, slower)
- ✗ Limited or no warranty (as-is or 90-day typical)
- ✗ Potential obsolescence (parts availability, software support)
- ✗ Higher maintenance costs (older = more repairs)
- ✗ May need retrofits or upgrades
- ✗ Harder to finance (lenders prefer newer equipment)

**New Machines:**

**Advantages:**
- ✓ Latest technology (faster, more accurate, better controls)
- ✓ Full warranty (typically 1-2 years comprehensive)
- ✓ Factory support and training
- ✓ Known condition (zero hours)
- ✓ Easier financing (better terms, higher LTV)
- ✓ Longer useful life (15-20 years vs. 10-15 for older used)
- ✓ Current software compatibility
- ✓ Modern features (wireless probing, automation-ready, etc.)

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ **High cost** (2-3x price of comparable used)
- ✗ Long lead times (6-12 months typical, longer for popular models)
- ✗ Rapid depreciation (loses 20-30% value in first year)
- ✗ May be "too much machine" (features you don't need)
- ✗ Higher debt service (larger loan payments)

**Decision Framework:**

**Buy Used If:**
- Limited startup capital (maximizing machines per dollar)
- Proven, mature technology sufficient (3-axis milling, standard turning)
- Can evaluate condition or hire inspector
- Comfortable with maintenance/repair
- Need equipment NOW (can't wait for new delivery)
- General job shop work (not cutting-edge aerospace)

**Buy New If:**
- Adequate capital (can afford without over-leveraging)
- Need latest technology (5-axis, high-speed, specific features)
- Customer requirements (aerospace may prefer newer equipment)
- Want warranty and support
- Long-term investment (plan to keep 15+ years)
- Financing advantages offset price difference

**Hybrid Strategy (Recommended for Most Startups):**
- **Primary revenue machine(s): Used** (proven Haas, Mazak, etc. 2012-2018)
- **Specialized/secondary equipment: New** if necessary (or older used if available)
- **Support equipment: Used** (bandsaw, grinder, manual machines)

**Example Startup Equipment Strategy:**
```
Primary Mill: Used Haas VF-3 (2016) - $65,000
  - Proven workhorse, affordable, parts available, good condition
Lathe: Used Haas TL-2 (2014) - $35,000
  - Lower utilization expected, used is cost-effective
Support: Used bandsaw, grinder, benches - $5,000
Total: $105,000

vs. All New:
Primary Mill: New Haas VF-3 - $135,000
Lathe: New Haas TL-2 - $85,000
Support: New equipment - $12,000
Total: $232,000

Savings: $127,000 (can buy additional used machine or keep as working capital)
```

### 7.1.2 General Purpose vs. Specialized

**General Purpose Machines:**
- 3-axis vertical mill
- Standard CNC lathe
- Can handle wide variety of work
- Versatile, flexible

**Specialized Machines:**
- 5-axis mill
- Swiss-type lathe
- Multi-tasking center
- Designed for specific applications

**Startup Recommendation: Start General Purpose**

**Why:**
- Lower cost (general purpose typically 30-50% less than specialized)
- Broader market (can quote wider variety of jobs)
- Easier to operate (less training required)
- Better utilization (more jobs fit capability)
- Lower risk (if niche doesn't work out, still have broad capability)

**When to Add Specialized:**
- Consistent demand for specific capability (have customers waiting)
- General purpose machines at high utilization (need additional capacity)
- Clear ROI case (can justify investment with committed work)
- Niche strategy requires it (Swiss-type shop, 5-axis specialist, etc.)

**Example Progression:**
```
Year 1: Start with 3-axis mill (general purpose)
Year 2: Add lathe (expand capability, still general purpose)
Year 3: Add 2nd mill (expand capacity)
Year 5: Add 4-axis or 5-axis (specialize, based on market demand)
```

### 7.1.3 Automation Level

**Automation Options:**
- **Manual load/unload** (operator present for each part)
- **Semi-automated** (pallet systems, bar feeders, parts catchers)
- **Fully automated** (robots, lights-out operation)

**Startup Recommendation: Manual Load/Unload**

**Why:**
- Lower initial cost (automation adds $20K-200K+)
- Flexibility (can run variety of parts without setup complexity)
- Learning curve (master basics before adding automation)
- Utilization (need high utilization to justify automation investment)

**When Automation Makes Sense:**
- Production runs (long cycle times, high volumes)
- Labor costs (automation cheaper than multiple shifts)
- Consistency (reduce operator variability)
- Capacity (lights-out operation during off-hours)

**Automation ROI Calculation:**
```
Pallet System Cost: $50,000
Benefit: Run 16 hours unattended (vs. 8 hours manual)
Additional capacity: 8 hours × 250 days = 2,000 hours/year
Revenue: 2,000 hours × $100/hr = $200,000/year
Gross Profit (60%): $120,000/year
Payback: $50,000 ÷ $120,000 = 0.42 years (5 months)

But: Requires consistent work to fill 16 hours/day
Reality: Year 1-3, unlikely to have sufficient utilization
```

**Automation Progression:**
```
Year 1-2: Manual operation, focus on winning customers
Year 3-4: Add simple automation (4th axis, bar feeder) for specific jobs
Year 5+: Consider pallet systems or robotics if utilization and demand justify
```

### 7.1.4 Service and Support Availability

**Critical Consideration: Can you get parts and service?**

**Evaluate:**
- **Dealer Network:** Local dealer? How far? Reputation?
- **Parts Availability:** Dealer stocks parts? Fast shipping?
- **Technical Support:** Phone support? Remote diagnostics? On-site service?
- **Training:** Training available? Documentation quality?
- **Control Obsolescence:** Is control still supported? Fanuc, Haas controls long-term support; proprietary controls risky.

**Red Flags:**
- Obscure brand with no local support (cheap machine isn't cheap if it's down 2 weeks waiting for parts from overseas)
- Proprietary controls no longer supported
- Dealer out of business or bad reputation
- Used machine with no service history or manuals

**Safe Bets for Startups:**
- **Haas:** Widespread, dealer network, good support, affordable
- **Mazak:** Strong support, quality machines, higher price
- **Okuma:** Good support, quality, moderate price
- **Fanuc Controls:** Industry standard, parts available, well-supported
- **Avoid:** Obscure imports, defunct brands (Bridgeport VMC), unsupported controls

**Support Value Example:**
```
Scenario: Spindle failure

Good Support (Haas):
- Call dealer: Same day response
- Part in stock locally or next-day ship
- Technician on-site within 2-3 days
- Downtime: 3-5 days
- Cost: $4,000 (part + labor)

Poor Support (Obscure Brand):
- No local dealer, call overseas distributor
- Part must ship from Asia: 3-6 weeks
- No technician available, hire independent (if you can find one)
- Downtime: 4-8 weeks
- Cost: $6,000 (part + shipping + independent tech)
- Lost revenue: 6 weeks × $4,000/week = $24,000

The "cheap" machine just cost you $30,000 vs. $4,000
```

**Recommendation:** Stick with mainstream brands and local dealer support, especially for primary revenue machines.

## 7.2 Evaluating Used Equipment

### 7.2.1 Inspection Checklist

**Never buy used equipment sight-unseen.** Inspect in person or hire professional inspector.

**Visual Inspection:**

**1. Overall Condition**
- [ ] Clean, well-maintained appearance (indicates care)
- [ ] Excessive wear, damage, or neglect (red flag)
- [ ] Paint condition (original vs. repainted to hide wear)
- [ ] Coolant leaks, oil stains (indicates seal wear)
- [ ] Rust or corrosion (storage conditions)

**2. Machine Structure**
- [ ] Check ways and slideways (wear, scoring, rust)
- [ ] Bellows condition (torn bellows = coolant/chip damage to ways)
- [ ] Column and bed (cracks, damage from crashes)
- [ ] Table surface (dings, gouges, excessive wear)

**3. Spindle**
- [ ] **Run spindle at various speeds:** Listen for unusual noise, vibration
- [ ] **Spindle warm-up:** Does it run smoothly after warm-up?
- [ ] **Spindle taper:** Inspect taper for scoring, damage
- [ ] **Tool release:** Test draw bar, tool change mechanism
- [ ] **Bearings:** Any grinding, roughness, play?
- [ ] Hours on spindle (if tracked, should be <10,000 hours for good condition)

**Critical:** Spindle is expensive to repair/replace ($5,000-25,000). Walk away if spindle shows significant issues unless price reflects needed repairs.

**4. Axes and Ball Screws**
- [ ] **Jog axes manually:** Smooth? Binding? Unusual noise?
- [ ] **Run axes at various feed rates:** Listen, feel for vibration
- [ ] **Backlash test:** Reverse direction, check for slop (should be minimal, <0.0005")
- [ ] **Ball screw condition:** Inspect for wear, damage, rust
- [ ] **Coupling inspection:** Check motor-to-ball screw couplings

**5. Control and Electronics**
- [ ] **Power up control:** Boots correctly? Alarms? Errors?
- [ ] **Screen quality:** Readable? Dead pixels? Touch response?
- [ ] **Memory:** Load and run a test program
- [ ] **I/O test:** Test buttons, switches, e-stop
- [ ] **Parameter backup:** Verify parameters can be backed up (critical for rebuild)

**6. Toolchanger (if applicable)**
- [ ] **Cycle toolchanger:** Smooth operation? Grinding?
- [ ] **Tool pot condition:** Wear? Damaged springs?
- [ ] **Repeatability:** Does tool seat consistently?
- [ ] **Arm condition:** Check gripper fingers, pneumatics

**7. Hydraulics and Pneumatics**
- [ ] **Hydraulic pump:** Noise level, leaks, pressure
- [ ] **Pneumatic system:** Air pressure adequate? Leaks?
- [ ] **Lubrication:** Auto-lube working? Oil level?

**Operational Tests:**

**1. Warm-Up Cycle**
Run machine for 30+ minutes (many issues only appear after warm-up)

**2. Test Cuts**
- Request permission to run test part
- Bring test program and material
- Evaluate finish, accuracy, performance

**3. Circular Interpolation Test**
- Program circular moves in XY, XZ, YZ planes
- Check for out-of-round (indicates backlash, servo issues)

**4. Crash Test Indications**
- Home machine: Does it home repeatably?
- Look for: Bent indicator holders, damaged fixtures on table (signs of crashes)
- Check: Any recently replaced parts? (may indicate recent crash repairs)

**Bring or Request:**
- [ ] Maintenance records
- [ ] Manuals and documentation
- [ ] Original purchase invoice (age verification)
- [ ] Parameter printouts or backup
- [ ] Service history
- [ ] Known issues or repairs needed

### 7.2.2 Machine History and Maintenance Records

**Questions to Ask Seller:**

1. **Why are you selling?**
   - Upgrading (good reason)
   - Going out of business (inspect extra carefully)
   - Unreliable/problems (red flag)

2. **How was the machine used?**
   - Production (high hours, consistent use)
   - Job shop (varied use, lower hours)
   - Education/training (low hours but often abused)
   - Prototyping (low hours, varied materials)

3. **Maintenance history:**
   - Regular preventive maintenance? (documented?)
   - Any major repairs? (spindle, ball screws, control?)
   - Who performed maintenance? (dealer vs. in-house vs. neglected)

4. **Hour meter reading:**
   - Total hours? (compare to age: 2,000 hrs/year is moderate)
   - Spindle hours? (if tracked separately)

5. **Crashes or damage:**
   - Any crashes? (be skeptical if they say "never")
   - Repairs performed after crashes?

6. **Environment:**
   - Climate controlled? (humidity control prevents rust)
   - Coolant type and maintenance? (indicates care)

**Red Flags:**
- ✗ Seller evasive or can't answer basic questions
- ✗ No maintenance records (indicates neglect)
- ✗ High hours for age (>3,000 hrs/year = heavy use)
- ✗ Multiple crashes or major repairs
- ✗ Storage in poor environment (rust, corrosion)
- ✗ "Needs minor repairs" (often not minor)
- ✗ Rushed sale, pressure to buy immediately

**Green Flags:**
- ✓ Detailed maintenance records
- ✓ Original manuals, documentation, backups
- ✓ Seller transparent about issues
- ✓ Climate-controlled environment
- ✓ Recent service or inspection available
- ✓ Machine running production (see it work)

### 7.2.3 Control System Obsolescence

**Control Longevity Matters**

**Long-Lived Controls (Good for Used Equipment):**
- **Fanuc:** 20-30+ year support, parts availability excellent
- **Haas NGC (2005+):** Still current, well-supported
- **Mazak Mazatrol:** Long support life
- **Siemens 840D:** Long-term support

**Obsolete or Risky Controls:**
- Older proprietary controls (manufacturer-specific, no longer supported)
- Haas pre-NGC (1990s controls, harder to support)
- Defunct manufacturers (Fadal Ultimax, Bridgeport VMCs)

**Control Age Guidelines:**

| Control Age | Status | Recommendation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| 0-10 years (2014-2024) | Current, full support | Safe to buy |
| 10-15 years (2009-2013) | Mature, good support | Generally safe if mainstream |
| 15-20 years (2004-2008) | Aging, support available | Evaluate carefully, plan for eventual obsolescence |
| 20+ years (pre-2004) | Obsolete risk | Avoid unless very cheap and you can service yourself |

**Upgrades and Retrofits:**
If you find a great mechanical machine with obsolete control, retrofitting is possible:
- Cost: $15,000-50,000 depending on machine size
- Benefit: Modern control, extended life
- Consider: Total cost (machine + retrofit) vs. newer machine

**Example:**
```
Option A: 2004 Mazak (Mazatrol T-Plus control) - $25,000
  Control aging, limited USB, slower processing
  Expected life: 5-10 years before control issues

Option B: 2015 Mazak (Mazatrol Matrix control) - $55,000
  Modern control, full support, faster
  Expected life: 15-20 years

Analysis: Extra $30K for 10+ years additional life = good value
```

### 7.2.4 Negotiating Price

**Research Fair Market Value:**

**Sources:**
- Machinery dealers (list prices)
- Machinio.com, MachineryMax.com (online listings)
- Auction results (sold prices, not asking prices)
- Equipment appraisers

**Factors Affecting Price:**

**Positive (Higher Value):**
- Low hours (<500 hrs/year of age)
- Excellent condition
- Complete documentation and tooling
- Recent service or inspection
- Desirable model/configuration
- Includes tooling, fixtures, accessories

**Negative (Lower Value):**
- High hours (>3,000 hrs/year)
- Poor condition, visible wear
- Crash history
- Missing manuals or accessories
- Needs repairs
- Obsolete control
- Difficult location (shipping cost)

**Negotiation Strategy:**

**1. Be Prepared:**
- Know fair market value
- Have financing arranged (can move quickly)
- Inspection completed (know condition)

**2. Identify Issues:**
- Document concerns found in inspection
- Get repair estimates for needed work
- Use as negotiation leverage

**3. Make Reasonable Offer:**
- Don't lowball (offends seller, kills negotiation)
- Start 10-20% below asking (if asking price reasonable)
- Justify with inspection findings, market comparables

**4. Be Ready to Walk:**
- Don't fall in love with a machine
- Plenty of used equipment available
- Walking away gives you power

**Example Negotiation:**
```
Listed Price: $50,000 (Used 2015 Haas VF-3, 8,000 hours)

Research: Similar machines selling for $45,000-55,000

Inspection Findings:
- Spindle noisy (may need bearings soon: ~$3,000)
- Ballscrew Y-axis slight wear
- Toolchanger sticky (needs adjustment)
- Overall condition: good but not excellent

Offer Strategy:
Initial offer: $42,000
Justification: Spindle concerns ($3,000 risk), minor issues, market comps
Seller counter: $48,000
Your counter: $45,000 ("Meet in the middle, I can pay cash and pick up this week")
Settle: $45,000-46,000 (reasonable outcome)
```

**Payment Considerations:**
- **Cash talks:** Sellers often discount for immediate cash payment
- **Financing:** Arranging your own financing gives you cash-buyer power
- **Deposit:** Be prepared to put down deposit to hold machine
- **Inspection contingency:** Include in offer ("Subject to satisfactory inspection")

## 7.3 Financing Options for Equipment

### 7.3.1 Bank Loans vs. Equipment Financing

**Traditional Bank Loan:**

**Characteristics:**
- General business loan that can be used for equipment
- Unsecured or secured by business assets
- Fixed or variable rate

**Terms:**
- Amount: Varies ($25K-500K+)
- Rate: 7-12%
- Term: 3-7 years
- Down payment: 20-30%

**Pros:**
- ✓ Can use for multiple equipment purchases
- ✓ Flexibility in how funds used
- ✓ May get better rate if strong credit

**Cons:**
- ✗ Harder to qualify (especially startups)
- ✗ Requires strong credit and business history
- ✗ Larger down payment
- ✗ Personal guarantee required

**Equipment Financing (Specialized):**

**Characteristics:**
- Loan specifically for equipment purchase
- Equipment serves as collateral
- Lender places lien on equipment

**Terms:**
- Amount: Up to 100% of equipment cost (90% typical)
- Rate: 6-10%
- Term: 3-7 years (matches equipment life)
- Down payment: 0-20% (often 10%)

**Pros:**
- ✓ Easier approval (equipment is collateral)
- ✓ Higher loan-to-value (LTV) ratios
- ✓ Lower down payment
- ✓ May approve startups (with strong personal credit)
- ✓ Streamlined process (faster than bank loan)

**Cons:**
- ✗ Lien on equipment (can't sell without paying off)
- ✗ Specific to equipment purchase (not flexible)
- ✗ Personal guarantee still required

**Which to Choose:**

**Equipment Financing If:**
- Buying specific machine
- Startup or limited business history
- Want minimal down payment
- Equipment is new or nearly new (better LTV)

**Bank Loan If:**
- Established business with strong financials
- Need flexibility (multiple purchases, working capital)
- Can afford larger down payment
- Equipment is older (lenders prefer newer for equipment financing)

### 7.3.2 Leasing vs. Buying

**Equipment Lease:**
Renting equipment for fixed term with option to return, renew, or buy out.

**Lease Types:**

**Operating Lease (True Lease):**
- Rent equipment for 2-5 years
- Return at end or buy out at Fair Market Value (FMV)
- Don't own equipment during or after lease (unless buy out)

**Finance Lease (Capital Lease):**
- Structured like financing
- $1 buyout at end of term (or nominal amount)
- Essentially own equipment (accounting treatment as asset)

**Lease Terms:**
- Monthly payment: Higher than loan payment (includes lessor profit/risk)
- Term: 2-5 years (operating), 5-7 years (finance)
- Down payment: Often $0 (100% financing)
- End options: Return, renew, or purchase (FMV or $1 depending on lease type)

**Leasing Example:**
```
Haas VF-4: $135,000

Operating Lease (5 years):
Monthly payment: ~$3,000
Total payments: $180,000
End options:
  - Return (owe nothing, no ownership)
  - Buy out: ~$40,000-50,000 (FMV)
  - Extend lease

Finance Lease (7 years):
Monthly payment: ~$2,300
Total payments: $193,200
End: $1 buyout (you own)
```

**Leasing Advantages:**
- ✓ Lower monthly payment (operating lease)
- ✓ 100% financing (no down payment)
- ✓ Easier approval (lessor owns equipment)
- ✓ Upgrade flexibility (return and lease newer after term)
- ✓ Tax deductions (lease payments deductible)
- ✓ Off-balance-sheet (operating lease, better financial ratios)

**Leasing Disadvantages:**
- ✗ No ownership (operating lease)
- ✗ Higher total cost than buying
- ✗ Locked into payments for term
- ✗ Penalties for early termination
- ✗ Restrictions (hours, usage limits sometimes)
- ✗ No equity build-up

**Buying Advantages:**
- ✓ Own equipment (asset on balance sheet)
- ✓ Build equity
- ✓ Lower total cost (no lessor profit)
- ✓ Flexibility (can sell, modify, etc.)
- ✓ Tax benefits (Section 179 depreciation)
- ✓ No ongoing obligation once paid off

**Buying Disadvantages:**
- ✗ Higher monthly payment (if financing)
- ✗ Down payment required (typically)
- ✗ Depreciation (asset loses value)
- ✗ Obsolescence risk (stuck with old equipment)
- ✗ Harder approval for financing

**Decision Framework:**

**Lease If:**
- Minimal capital (need 100% financing)
- Want lower monthly payment
- Uncertain about equipment needs (want upgrade flexibility)
- Testing business viability (don't want long-term commitment)
- Technology changes rapidly (want to upgrade every 3-5 years)

**Buy If:**
- Want to build equity and ownership
- Lower total cost priority
- Equipment has long useful life (15-20 years)
- Stable business, confident in equipment needs
- Can afford down payment

**Reality for CNC Shops:**
Most CNC equipment has long useful life (15-20+ years), making ownership economically better. **Buy (finance if needed) is typically better financial decision unless cash flow or flexibility is critical concern.**

### 7.3.3 Sale-Leaseback Arrangements

**Sale-Leaseback:**
Own equipment? Sell it to leasing company, then lease it back.

**How It Works:**
```
1. You own Haas VF-3 (purchased 2 years ago, paid off)
2. Appraised value: $60,000
3. Leasing company buys it from you for $60,000 (you receive cash)
4. You lease it back: $1,200/month for 60 months
5. At end: Buy out for FMV or $1 (depending on lease type)
```

**Why Consider:**
- Free up cash (convert equipment equity to working capital)
- Improve cash flow (monthly payment vs. tied-up capital)
- Tax benefits (lease payments deductible)

**When It Makes Sense:**
- Cash flow crunch (need working capital)
- Rapid growth requiring capital
- Other investment opportunities with higher return than lease cost

**Downside:**
- Pay to lease equipment you already owned
- Higher total cost (lease payments exceed equipment value)
- Don't own equipment during lease

**Rarely Recommended for Startups:** Better to finance from beginning or buy cash if possible.

### 7.3.4 Vendor Financing Programs

**Machine Tool Builders Offer Financing:**

**Haas Factory Outlet (HFO) Financing:**
- In-house financing through Wells Fargo
- Competitive rates (6-9%)
- Fast approval (days)
- 0% promotions occasionally

**Mazak Capital:**
- Mazak's financing arm
- Competitive rates
- May offer incentives (delayed payments, low rates)

**DMG Mori Financial Services:**
- Similar to above

**Advantages:**
- ✓ One-stop shopping (machine + financing)
- ✓ Streamlined process
- ✓ May offer promotions (0% for 12 months, etc.)
- ✓ Builder wants to sell (easier approval sometimes)

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ May not be best rate (shop around)
- ✗ Tied to that builder
- ✗ Personal guarantee still required

**Recommendation:** Get vendor financing quote, but also get quotes from banks, credit unions, and equipment financing companies. Compare and negotiate.

## 7.4 ROI Analysis and Justification

### 7.4.1 Payback Period Calculation

**Payback Period:** How long to recoup investment through cash flow generated.

**Formula:**
```
Payback Period = Initial Investment ÷ Annual Cash Flow

Annual Cash Flow = Annual Revenue - Annual Costs
```

**Example:**
```
Equipment: Haas VF-4 (new): $135,000
Down payment (20%): $27,000
Financed: $108,000 (7 years, 8%, $1,720/month)

Projected Revenue from Machine:
Billable rate: $110/hr
Utilization: 50% (Year 1), 70% (Year 2), 80% (Year 3)
Available hours: 2,000/year

Year 1 Revenue: 2,000 × 50% × $110 = $110,000
Year 2 Revenue: 2,000 × 70% × $110 = $154,000
Year 3 Revenue: 2,000 × 80% × $110 = $176,000

Costs:
Materials/tooling (30% of revenue): $33K, $46K, $53K
Loan payment: $20,640/year (all years)
Allocated overhead: $12,000/year

Year 1 Cash Flow: $110K - $33K - $20.6K - $12K = $44,400
Year 2 Cash Flow: $154K - $46K - $20.6K - $12K = $75,400
Year 3 Cash Flow: $176K - $53K - $20.6K - $12K = $90,400

Simple Payback on Down Payment:
$27,000 ÷ $44,400/year = 0.61 years (7.3 months)

Total Investment Payback (including financed amount):
Year 1 cash flow: $44,400
Year 2 cash flow: $75,400
Year 3 cash flow: $90,400 (partial)

Cumulative:
Year 1: $44,400 (need $90,600 more to reach $135K)
Year 2: $119,800 (need $15,200 more)
Year 3 (partial): $15,200 ÷ $90,400 = 0.17 years (~2 months)

Total Payback: 2.2 years
```

**Payback Period Targets:**

| Payback Period | Assessment |
|----------------|------------|
| < 1 year | Excellent - immediate ROI |
| 1-2 years | Very good - strong investment |
| 2-3 years | Good - acceptable for growth |
| 3-5 years | Fair - marginal, evaluate carefully |
| > 5 years | Poor - reconsider investment |

**For CNC Equipment: 2-4 year payback typical and acceptable.**

### 7.4.2 Net Present Value (NPV)

**NPV:** Accounts for time value of money (a dollar today worth more than a dollar in 5 years).

**Concept:**
- Discount future cash flows to present value
- Compare to initial investment
- Positive NPV = good investment

**Formula:**
```
NPV = Σ [Cash Flow Year N ÷ (1 + Discount Rate)^N] - Initial Investment
```

**Example (Using Above Cash Flows):**
```
Initial Investment: $135,000
Discount Rate: 10% (your required return)

Year 1 PV: $44,400 ÷ (1.10)^1 = $40,364
Year 2 PV: $75,400 ÷ (1.10)^2 = $62,314
Year 3 PV: $90,400 ÷ (1.10)^3 = $67,914
Year 4 PV: $90,400 ÷ (1.10)^4 = $61,740
Year 5 PV: $90,400 ÷ (1.10)^5 = $56,127

Total PV (5 years): $288,459
NPV: $288,459 - $135,000 = $153,459

NPV > 0 = Good Investment
```

**Interpretation:**
- **NPV > 0:** Investment returns more than required discount rate (do it)
- **NPV = 0:** Investment returns exactly discount rate (breakeven)
- **NPV < 0:** Investment returns less than discount rate (don't do it)

**Sensitivity:**
NPV sensitive to discount rate. Higher discount rate (higher required return) = lower NPV.

### 7.4.3 Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

**IRR:** The discount rate at which NPV = 0. Tells you the actual return % on investment.

**Example:**
Using above cash flows, IRR ≈ 45% (calculated via spreadsheet or financial calculator).

**Interpretation:**
- IRR of 45% means investment returns 45% annually
- Compare to required return (hurdle rate, say 15%)
- 45% > 15% = Excellent investment

**Decision Rule:**
- **IRR > Required Return:** Accept investment
- **IRR < Required Return:** Reject investment

**Ranking Investments:**
If evaluating multiple equipment options, higher IRR = better return.

**Note:** For simple equipment purchases, **Payback Period often sufficient**. NPV and IRR more useful for large, complex investments or comparing multiple options.

## 7.6 Service Contracts and Warranties

### New Machine Warranty

**Standard New Machine Warranty:**
- Comprehensive: 1-2 years
- Covers: Defects in materials and workmanship
- Excludes: Abuse, crashes, normal wear items (belts, seals)

**What's Covered:**
- Parts and labor
- Travel (dealer technician comes to you)
- Usually unlimited service calls

**What's NOT Covered:**
- Consumables (cutting tools, coolant)
- Damage from crashes or misuse
- Normal wear (belts, way covers, etc. after 1 year)

**Extended Warranty:**
- Available for purchase (3-5 years total coverage)
- Cost: $3,000-10,000 depending on machine
- Worth it?: Depends on machine reliability, your ability to self-service

**Recommendation:**
- Standard warranty sufficient for Haas, Mazak, Okuma (reliable)
- Consider extended for complex/expensive machines (5-axis, Swiss)
- Skip for used machines (not available anyway)

### Used Machine Warranty

**Typical Used Machine Warranty:**
- 30-90 days limited warranty (if from dealer)
- Often "as-is" (private party sales)

**What to Expect:**
- Covers: Major component failure (spindle, ballscrews)
- Excludes: Everything else
- Dealer may offer extended for additional cost

**Recommendation:**
- Inspect thoroughly before purchase
- Budget for repairs (plan on spending 10-20% of purchase price on repairs/maintenance in first 2 years)
- Don't rely on warranty - assume as-is

### Service Contracts (Annual Preventive Maintenance)

**Service Contract:**
Annual agreement for preventive maintenance visits.

**Typical Service Contract:**
- 2-4 visits per year
- Preventive maintenance (lubrication, inspection, adjustments)
- Priority service (faster response)
- Discounted labor rates
- Cost: $2,000-6,000/year per machine

**What's Included:**
- Scheduled PM visits
- Inspect, clean, lubricate
- Adjust as needed
- Parts extra (usually)

**Worth It?**
- **Yes if:** Expensive/complex machine, you lack maintenance skills, critical uptime
- **No if:** Simple machine, you can perform PM yourself, tight budget

**Alternative:**
- DIY preventive maintenance (follow manual)
- On-demand service (call dealer when needed)
- Hybrid: Annual inspection, DIY monthly/quarterly PM

**Recommendation for Startups:**
- **Year 1:** On-demand service (save money, learn machine)
- **Year 2+:** Consider service contract if business depends on uptime

## 7.7 When to Add vs. When to Wait

**Adding Equipment Decisions:**

**Financial Indicators (ALL must be true):**
- ✓ Existing equipment >80% utilized for 3+ months
- ✓ Business profitable (net margin >10%)
- ✓ Cash reserves adequate (6 months operating expenses)
- ✓ Clear ROI (payback <3 years)

**Operational Indicators:**
- ✓ Turning down work due to capacity
- ✓ Excessive lead times (customers complaining)
- ✓ Working excessive overtime consistently
- ✓ Backlog 4-6+ weeks consistently

**Strategic Indicators:**
- ✓ New equipment enables new markets/customers
- ✓ Customer requests for capability you don't have
- ✓ Competitive advantage (5-axis, automation, etc.)

**When to Wait:**
- ✗ Current equipment <70% utilized
- ✗ Unstable revenue (inconsistent months)
- ✗ Cash flow tight
- ✗ Speculative (hoping equipment will attract work)
- ✗ No clear ROI case

**Common Mistake:**
Adding equipment hoping it will attract customers. **Reality:** Customers first, then equipment. Don't build excess capacity on speculation.

**Right Sequence:**
```
1. Win customers with existing capacity
2. Reach high utilization (80%+)
3. Turn down work or extend lead times
4. Add equipment to serve existing and waiting demand
5. Repeat
```

## Conclusion

Equipment decisions are critical to business success. Smart equipment strategies balance capability, cost, financing, and timing.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Used Equipment Offers Huge Value:** 40-70% savings vs. new, allowing more capacity for less capital. Startups should strongly consider used for primary machines.

2. **Inspect Thoroughly:** Never buy sight-unseen. Hire professional inspector if you lack expertise. Spindle and control condition are critical.

3. **Financing Preserves Capital:** Equipment financing allows 80-100% financing, preserving working capital. Shop multiple lenders for best terms.

4. **Buy > Lease for CNC:** Long equipment life makes ownership better economics than leasing in most cases.

5. **ROI Analysis Required:** Calculate payback period. Target 2-4 years for CNC equipment. Don't buy speculatively.

6. **Service and Support Matter:** Buy mainstream brands with local dealer support. Downtime kills profits.

7. **Add Capacity Based on Demand:** Wait for high utilization (80%+) and clear demand before adding equipment. Don't build excess capacity hoping for customers.

8. **Budget for Total Costs:** Equipment purchase price is only 70-80% of total cost. Include delivery, installation, training, initial tooling, and contingency.

**Equipment is a means to an end—generating profitable revenue. Always tie equipment decisions to customer demand, capacity needs, and clear financial justification. Patient, strategic equipment acquisition builds sustainable business; impulsive equipment buying leads to debt and underutilization.**
