# Module 23 – Shop Organization and Management


## Introduction

**Inventory** is material held in stock:
- Raw materials waiting to be processed
- Work-in-process (WIP) between operations
- Finished goods awaiting shipment
- Consumables and MRO supplies

**The Inventory Paradox:**

**Too little inventory** causes:
- Production delays (waiting for material)
- Lost sales (can't fulfill orders)
- Expediting costs (rush deliveries)
- Customer dissatisfaction

**Too much inventory** causes:
- Cash tied up (can't use for other needs)
- Storage space consumed
- Carrying costs (20-30% of inventory value annually)
- Obsolescence risk (material goes bad or becomes obsolete)
- Hidden problems (excess inventory masks inefficiencies)

**The Goal**: Right amount of inventory—enough to meet demand without excess.

This section covers inventory types, control methods, and strategies for optimizing inventory levels.

## 23.7.1 Inventory Types in CNC Manufacturing

### 23.7.1.1 Raw Materials

**Definition**: Unprocessed material (bar stock, plate, castings, forgings)

**Purpose**:
- Enable production without waiting for supplier deliveries
- Buffer against supplier lead time variability
- Take advantage of volume discounts

**Challenges**:
- Large variety (many alloys, sizes)
- Space-intensive (long bars, heavy plates)
- Capital investment
- Risk of obsolescence (material for discontinued parts)

**Typical Raw Material Inventory**: 1-3 months supply

### 23.7.1.2 Work in Progress (WIP)

**Definition**: Parts started but not yet complete

**Forms of WIP**:
- Parts at machines (current job)
- Parts between operations (waiting for next step)
- Parts at inspection
- Parts waiting for outside services (heat treat, plating)

**Purpose**:
- Maintain flow (next operation has material)
- Absorb variation (different cycle times between operations)

**Problem**: WIP is waste in Lean thinking
- Ties up cash
- Consumes floor space
- Hides problems (quality issues discovered late)
- Increases lead time

**Goal**: Minimize WIP while maintaining flow

**Typical WIP**: 2-4 weeks of production value

### 23.7.1.3 Finished Goods

**Definition**: Completed parts ready to ship

**Purpose**:
- **Make-to-stock**: Produce in advance, ship quickly when ordered
- **Buffer**: Absorb demand variability
- **Consolidate shipments**: Accumulate multiple items for one delivery

**When to Hold Finished Goods:**

**Make-to-Stock** (hold inventory):
- High-volume standard products
- Predictable demand
- Customers expect immediate availability
- Example: Distributor, catalog parts

**Make-to-Order** (minimize inventory):
- Custom parts (one-time or low-volume)
- Unpredictable demand
- Customer OK with lead time
- Example: Job shop, prototype work

**Typical Finished Goods**: 0-4 weeks (depends on business model)

### 23.7.1.4 MRO (Maintenance, Repair, Operations)

**Definition**: Consumable supplies and spare parts

**Examples**:
- Cutting tools
- Coolant and lubricants
- Shop supplies (rags, gloves, tape)
- Spare parts (motors, bearings, filters)
- Gage consumables (batteries, tips)

**Purpose**:
- Keep operations running (no waiting for supplies)
- Prevent downtime (spare parts available)

**Challenge**: Large number of SKUs (stock-keeping units)
- Difficult to track and manage
- Low usage items (may never be used)

**Typical MRO Inventory**: 3-6 months supply (or more for slow-moving items)

---

## 23.7.2 Inventory Control Methods

### 23.7.2.1 ABC Analysis

**ABC Analysis**: Classify inventory by importance (Pareto Principle: 80/20 rule)

**Classification:**

**A Items** (High Value):
- 20% of SKUs, 80% of inventory value
- Tight control, frequent review
- Accurate records
- Example: Expensive materials, high-usage cutting tools

**B Items** (Medium Value):
- 30% of SKUs, 15% of inventory value
- Moderate control, periodic review
- Example: Standard materials, common tools

**C Items** (Low Value):
- 50% of SKUs, 5% of inventory value
- Simple control, infrequent review
- Keep ample stock (low cost to hold)
- Example: Fasteners, shop supplies, rare spare parts

**How to Perform ABC Analysis:**

1. **Calculate Annual Usage Value** for each item:
   ```
   Annual Usage Value = Annual Usage Quantity × Unit Cost
   ```

2. **Rank items** by annual usage value (high to low)

3. **Calculate Cumulative Percentage** of total value

4. **Classify**:
   - Top items to 80% cumulative = A
   - Next items to 95% cumulative = B
   - Remaining items = C

**Example:**

| Item | Annual Qty | Unit Cost | Annual Value | Cumulative % | Class |
|------|------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| 6061-T6 2" bar | 5,000 ft | $8/ft | $40,000 | 40% | A |
| 4140 Steel 3" bar | 1,200 ft | $12/ft | $14,400 | 54% | A |
| 1/2" 4Fl endmill | 500 | $40 | $20,000 | 74% | A |
| 303 SS 1.5" bar | 800 ft | $10/ft | $8,000 | 82% | A |
| Tool holders | 50 | $150 | $7,500 | 90% | B |
| Coolant (gal) | 200 | $30 | $6,000 | 96% | B |
| Shop rags (box) | 100 | $25 | $2,500 | 98.5% | C |
| Gloves (pairs) | 500 | $3 | $1,500 | 100% | C |

**Management by Class:**

| Class | Control Method |
|-------|---------------|
| **A** | - Weekly or daily review<br>- Accurate records<br>- Frequent orders (smaller quantities)<br>- Negotiate pricing<br>- Consider JIT delivery |
| **B** | - Monthly review<br>- Standard reorder points<br>- Moderate safety stock |
| **C** | - Quarterly or annual review<br>- Large orders (volume discount)<br>- High safety stock (cheap to hold, expensive to run out) |

### 23.7.2.2 Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)

**EOQ**: Optimal order quantity that minimizes total inventory cost

**Total Inventory Cost** = Ordering Cost + Holding Cost

**Ordering Cost**:
- Cost to place and receive an order (labor, paperwork, inspection)
- Fixed per order (regardless of quantity)
- More frequent orders → higher annual ordering cost

**Holding Cost**:
- Cost to store inventory (space, insurance, capital, obsolescence)
- Variable (proportional to quantity held)
- Larger orders → higher holding cost

**EOQ Formula:**

```
       ┌──────────────
       │  2 × D × S
EOQ = √  ──────────
       │      H
       └
```

Where:
- **D** = Annual demand (units/year)
- **S** = Ordering cost ($ per order)
- **H** = Holding cost ($ per unit per year)

**Example:**

**6061-T6 Aluminum, 2" diameter bar:**
- **D** = 5,000 ft/year
- **S** = $50 per order (labor, paperwork, receiving)
- **H** = $2/ft/year (20% carrying cost on $10/ft material)

```
       ┌──────────────────
       │  2 × 5,000 × 50
EOQ = √  ──────────────
       │        2
       └

     = √(500,000 / 2)
     = √250,000
     = 500 ft
```

**Optimal order quantity**: 500 ft per order

**Orders per year**: 5,000 / 500 = 10 orders

**Reorder every**: 365 / 10 = ~36 days

**Total Cost at EOQ:**

```
Total Cost = (D/Q × S) + (Q/2 × H)
           = (5,000/500 × $50) + (500/2 × $2)
           = (10 × $50) + (250 × $2)
           = $500 + $500
           = $1,000/year
```

**Note**: At EOQ, ordering cost = holding cost (both $500 in this example).

**Practical Considerations:**

- EOQ is a starting point (adjust for supplier minimums, truck capacity, storage space)
- More relevant for high-volume, stable demand items
- Less useful for custom or low-volume items

### 23.7.2.3 Safety Stock Calculations

**Safety Stock**: Extra inventory to buffer against uncertainty

**Sources of Uncertainty:**
- **Demand variability**: Actual usage differs from forecast
- **Lead time variability**: Supplier delivers late
- **Quality issues**: Some received material is bad

**Safety Stock Formula (Basic):**

```
Safety Stock = Z × σ × √LT
```

Where:
- **Z** = Service level factor (statistical)
  - 95% service level: Z = 1.65
  - 99% service level: Z = 2.33
- **σ** = Standard deviation of demand (variability)
- **LT** = Lead time (in same period as σ)

**Example:**

**1/2" Endmill:**
- Average weekly usage: 10 endmills
- Standard deviation: 3 endmills
- Supplier lead time: 2 weeks
- Desired service level: 95% (Z = 1.65)

```
Safety Stock = 1.65 × 3 × √2
             = 1.65 × 3 × 1.41
             = 7 endmills
```

**Interpretation**: Carry 7 extra endmills to have 95% chance of not running out during lead time.

**Simpler Rule of Thumb:**

Safety Stock = 1-2 weeks of typical usage (for A and B items)

**Trade-Off:**
- Higher safety stock → less risk of stockout, higher carrying cost
- Lower safety stock → lower carrying cost, higher stockout risk

### 23.7.2.4 Reorder Point Systems

**Reorder Point (ROP)**: Inventory level that triggers new order

**Formula:**

```
ROP = (Average Daily Usage × Lead Time) + Safety Stock
```

**Example:**

**1/2" Endmill:**
- Average daily usage: 2 endmills
- Lead time: 10 working days
- Safety stock: 7 endmills

```
ROP = (2 × 10) + 7
    = 20 + 7
    = 27 endmills
```

**Interpretation**: When inventory drops to 27, place new order.

**Visual Reorder Point:**

Mark bins or shelves:
- Green zone: Above reorder point (OK)
- Yellow zone: At reorder point (order now)
- Red zone: Below safety stock (critical, expedite)

**Two-Bin System** (Kanban):
- Bin A and Bin B each hold ROP quantity
- Use from Bin A until empty
- When Bin A empty, trigger reorder and switch to Bin B
- Bin A refills while using Bin B
- Simple, foolproof

## 23.7.3 Just-In-Time (JIT) Inventory

**JIT Philosophy**: Produce and deliver exactly what's needed, when needed, in the exact quantity needed.

**Goal**: Zero inventory (theoretical ideal)

**Reality**: Minimal inventory with frequent replenishment

### JIT Principles

1. **Pull System**: Produce only when customer orders (not forecast)
2. **Small Batches**: Frequent production runs (reduce inventory)
3. **Fast Setups**: Enable small batches economically (SMED)
4. **Reliable Processes**: No defects (can't afford buffer inventory to cover scrap)
5. **Reliable Suppliers**: On-time delivery, high quality, frequent deliveries
6. **Level Production**: Smooth, predictable demand (avoid spikes)

### Benefits of JIT

- **Reduced inventory cost**: Less cash tied up, less storage space
- **Shorter lead times**: Material flows quickly (not sitting in queues)
- **Higher quality**: Problems discovered immediately (no buffer to hide them)
- **Flexibility**: Easier to change (less WIP to rework or scrap)

### Challenges of JIT

- **Requires discipline**: No tolerance for variation
- **Vulnerable to disruptions**: Supplier delay or quality issue stops production
- **Requires reliable suppliers**: Must deliver frequently and consistently
- **Cultural change**: Shift from "just in case" mentality

### Implementing JIT (Gradual)

**Don't jump to zero inventory overnight.** Progress through stages:

**Stage 1**: Reduce excess inventory (clear out obsolete, slow movers)
- ABC analysis
- Eliminate duplicates
- Reduce safety stock gradually

**Stage 2**: Improve processes
- Reduce setup times (SMED)
- Improve quality (reduce scrap and rework)
- Stabilize processes (reduce variability)

**Stage 3**: Work with suppliers
- More frequent deliveries (smaller quantities)
- Consignment inventory (supplier owns until used)
- Vendor-managed inventory (VMI)

**Stage 4**: Pull systems (Kanban)
- Visual signals for replenishment
- Link production to actual demand

**Stage 5**: Continuous improvement
- Further reduce lead times and batch sizes
- Tighter integration with customers and suppliers

## 23.7.4 Kanban Systems for Inventory

**Kanban**: Visual signal for replenishment (Japanese: "card" or "signal")

### How Kanban Works

1. **Production consumes material** from container/bin
2. **Empty container** or reaching min level is the **signal** (kanban)
3. **Signal triggers replenishment** (order more or produce more)
4. **Material is replenished**
5. **Cycle repeats**

**No complex forecasting or scheduling—just respond to actual consumption.**

### Types of Kanban

**1. Two-Bin Kanban**

(Covered in Section 23.4.2.2 - Tool Inventory)

- Two bins, each holds enough for lead time + safety stock
- Use Bin A → empty → signal reorder → switch to Bin B
- Bin A refills → becomes backup

**2. Card Kanban**

- Card attached to container
- When container used, remove card
- Card goes to reorder board
- Purchasing or production refills, returns card with new material

**3. Signal Kanban (Triangle or Color)**

- Visual marker (e.g., colored ball, triangle card)
- Placed at reorder point in container
- When reached, signal visible → reorder

**4. Electronic Kanban**

- Scan barcode when material used
- System sends automatic reorder signal
- No physical cards

### Designing a Kanban System

**Step 1: Determine Kanban Quantity**

Quantity per container (one kanban):

```
Kanban Qty = (Avg Daily Usage × Lead Time × Safety Factor) / # of Kanbans
```

Usually 2-3 kanbans (containers) per item.

**Example:**

**1/2" Endmill:**
- Avg daily usage: 2
- Lead time: 10 days
- Safety factor: 1.2 (20% buffer)
- Number of kanbans: 2

```
Kanban Qty = (2 × 10 × 1.2) / 2
           = 24 / 2
           = 12 endmills per kanban
```

**Result**: Two bins, each holding 12 endmills (24 total).

**Step 2: Label Containers**

Each container clearly labeled:
- Item description
- Kanban quantity
- Reorder information (supplier, part number)

**Step 3: Establish Pull Process**

- Users take from designated location
- Empty container or card triggers replenishment
- Refilled container returns to location

**Step 4: Discipline**

- Follow the system (don't bypass)
- Maintain kanban quantities (don't change without analysis)
- Visual management (everyone sees status)

### Benefits of Kanban

- **Simple**: Visual, no complex calculations daily
- **Self-regulating**: Automatically adjusts to actual usage
- **Reduced inventory**: Minimal excess
- **Fewer stockouts**: Replenishment based on real consumption

## 23.7.5 Inventory Accuracy and Cycle Counting

**Inventory Records**: Data on what you have (quantity, location)

**Physical Inventory**: Actual material on hand

**Problem**: Records and physical often don't match (errors, theft, loss, miscount)

**Goal**: **99%+ inventory accuracy** (records match physical reality)

### Sources of Inventory Errors

- Receiving errors (counted wrong, entered wrong)
- Issuing errors (material taken, not recorded)
- Misplacement (material in wrong location)
- Scrap not recorded
- Theft or loss
- Data entry mistakes

### Annual Physical Inventory (Traditional)

**Process:**
- Once per year, shut down production
- Count everything
- Adjust records to match physical count
- Resume production

**Problems:**
- Disruptive (production stops)
- Once per year (errors accumulate)
- Rush job (prone to counting errors)
- Doesn't identify root causes

### Cycle Counting (Modern Approach)

**Cycle Counting**: Count small portions of inventory frequently

**Process:**
1. **Divide inventory into groups** (often by ABC class)
2. **Count one group per day/week**
3. **Compare count to records**
4. **Investigate discrepancies** (find root cause)
5. **Adjust records** if necessary
6. **Fix root cause** (prevent recurrence)

**Cycle Count Frequency:**

| Class | Frequency | Annual Counts |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| **A** | Weekly or monthly | 12-52× per year |
| **B** | Monthly or quarterly | 4-12× per year |
| **C** | Quarterly or annually | 1-4× per year |

**Example:**

Shop with 200 SKUs:
- A items (20 SKUs): Count 5 per week → all A items counted quarterly
- B items (60 SKUs): Count 5 per week → all B items counted every 12 weeks
- C items (120 SKUs): Count 10 per month → all C items counted annually

**Benefits of Cycle Counting:**

- **No shutdown**: Counts done during normal operations
- **Higher accuracy**: Frequent counts catch errors early
- **Root cause focus**: Investigate and fix causes of errors
- **Continuous**: Always working toward accurate records

### Improving Inventory Accuracy

**1. Transaction Discipline**

- Record every transaction immediately (receive, issue, scrap)
- No "I'll enter it later" (will forget)
- Simple tools (barcode scanners, tablets on shop floor)

**2. Training**

- Everyone understands importance of accuracy
- Training on correct procedures

**3. Root Cause Analysis**

When discrepancy found:
- Don't just adjust and move on
- Investigate: Why did this happen?
- Fix process to prevent recurrence

**4. Accountability**

- Inventory accuracy is a performance metric
- Recognize good performance
- Address poor performance

**5. Simplified Processes**

- Reduce transaction complexity
- Eliminate redundant steps
- Make correct process easy to follow

## 23.7.6 Reducing Inventory Carrying Costs

**Carrying Cost**: Cost to hold inventory (not just purchase price)

**Components of Carrying Cost:**

1. **Capital Cost**: Money tied up (can't invest elsewhere)
   - Typical: 8-15% per year (cost of capital)

2. **Storage Cost**: Space, racks, utilities
   - Typical: 2-5% per year

3. **Handling Cost**: Moving, managing, tracking
   - Typical: 2-3% per year

4. **Obsolescence/Shrinkage**: Material goes bad, lost, stolen
   - Typical: 2-5% per year

5. **Insurance and Taxes**: Insure inventory, property tax
   - Typical: 1-3% per year

**Total Carrying Cost**: 15-30% of inventory value annually

**Example:**

$100,000 inventory at 25% carrying cost = **$25,000/year**

**Strategies to Reduce Carrying Cost:**

**1. Reduce Inventory Levels**

- ABC analysis (focus on high-value items)
- Reduce safety stock (improve forecast accuracy, supplier reliability)
- Smaller order quantities (more frequent orders)
- Eliminate slow movers and obsolete items

**2. Faster Turnover**

Inventory turnover ratio:
```
Inventory Turnover = Annual Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory Value
```

Higher turnover = inventory moves through faster = less carrying cost

**Example:**
- $1M annual COGS
- $200,000 avg inventory
- Turnover = 5× per year (inventory replaced 5 times)

**Goal**: Increase turnover (reduce inventory or increase sales)

**3. Consignment Inventory**

- Supplier owns inventory until you use it
- Stored at your location (available when needed)
- You don't pay carrying cost (supplier does)
- Negotiate with key suppliers

**4. Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI)**

- Supplier monitors your usage
- Supplier replenishes automatically (maintains agreed levels)
- You don't manage—supplier does
- Frees your resources, reduces carrying cost

**5. JIT and Pull Systems**

- Frequent deliveries, small quantities
- Minimal inventory on hand
- Requires reliable supplier relationships

**6. Eliminate Obsolete Inventory**

- Regular reviews (quarterly or annually)
- Identify slow movers (not used in 6-12 months)
- Disposition: Return to supplier, sell, scrap
- Don't let it sit forever

---

## Summary

Inventory management balances availability with cost. Too little causes delays and lost sales; too much ties up cash and space.

Key methods include:
- **ABC Analysis**: Focus on high-value items
- **EOQ**: Optimal order quantity balancing ordering and holding costs
- **Safety Stock**: Buffer against demand and lead time variability
- **Reorder Point Systems**: Trigger orders at the right time
- **JIT**: Minimize inventory through pull systems and frequent replenishment
- **Kanban**: Visual signals for simple, effective replenishment
- **Cycle Counting**: Maintain inventory accuracy through frequent counts
- **Reduce carrying costs**: Through turnover, consignment, VMI, and eliminating excess

Effective inventory management frees cash, reduces lead times, and improves customer service—all while maintaining smooth operations.

In the next section, we'll explore document control and information management—organizing the information that supports manufacturing.
