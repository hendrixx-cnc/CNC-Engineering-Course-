# Module 23 – Shop Organization and Management


## Introduction

**Digital transformation** is reshaping manufacturing. Technology enables visibility, connectivity, automation, and data-driven decision-making that were impossible a generation ago.

**The Evolution:**

**1980s-1990s**: CNC controls revolutionized machining (computer control vs. manual)

**2000s**: ERP systems integrated business processes (orders, inventory, accounting)

**2010s**: MES and machine monitoring provided shop floor visibility

**2020s+**: IoT, AI, cloud computing enable Industry 4.0 / Smart Manufacturing

**Why Technology Matters:**

**Without digital systems:**
- Information trapped in paper, spreadsheets, or individual computers

- Difficult analysis (can't easily spot trends, patterns)

**With digital systems:**
- Real-time visibility (see status instantly)
- Automated data capture (accurate, effortless)
- Data-driven decisions (facts, not guesses)
- Connected operations (ERP ↔ MES ↔ Machines ↔ Quality)

**This section covers:**
- Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES)
- Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
- Shop floor data collection (barcode, RFID, machine monitoring)
- CAM data management (PDM/PLM)
- Digital work instructions
- IoT and Industry 4.0 integration
