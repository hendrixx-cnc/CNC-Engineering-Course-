### Linear Axes and Cable Carriers

**External Linear Guides**

If robot has external linear axes:
- Oil or grease per guide manufacturer
- Typically every 100 km of travel or monthly
- Wipe rails clean first
- Apply thin, even coat

**Cable Carriers**

Light oil on pivot points:
- Prevents wear and squeaking
- Every 6 months
- Use dry lubricant in dusty environments

## Encoders and Feedback

### Encoder Maintenance

**Cleaning**

Optical Encoders:
- Keep code disc clean (if exposed)
- Use compressed air only
- Never touch disc surface

Magnetic Encoders:

Poor Signals Indicate:
- Contamination
- Misalignment
- Cable damage
- Failing encoder

### Encoder Battery Replacement

**Absolute Encoders with Battery Backup**

Purpose:
- Maintain position data during power loss
- Avoid re-mastering (homing)

Procedure:
1. Note current position data (backup)
2. Power on controller
3. Replace battery while powered (no data loss)
4. Verify position retained
5. Or: Replace battery unpowered, then re-master

**Mastering Procedure (if position lost)**

Different per manufacturer:
1. Mechanical mastering: Move to physical reference marks
2. Electronic mastering: Use master tool or controller function
3. Store new zero positions in controller

Critical:
- Mastering errors cause positioning errors
- Follow manufacturer procedure exactly
- Verify with test program after mastering

## Calibration Maintenance

### TCP Calibration Verification

**Procedure**

1. Jog robot to known reference point from four different orientations
2. Measure variation in reference point position
3. Variation should be <0.1 mm
4. If larger, re-calibrate TCP

**Automated Calibration**

Some systems:
- Touch probe on robot
- Probe calibrated artifact (sphere, plane)
- Controller calculates TCP automatically

### Payload Calibration

**Purpose**

Accurate payload data improves:
- Motion control (feedforward compensation)
- Collision detection sensitivity
- Energy efficiency

**Update When**

- Tool or gripper changed
- Payload significantly different
- Poor motion quality observed

**Method**

1. Mount tool with known mass and center of gravity
2. Run identification routine (moves through poses, measures currents)
3. Controller calculates payload parameters
4. Store in tool data

## Preventive Maintenance Best Practices

### Record Keeping

**Maintenance Log**

Document:

- Maintenance performed
- Parts replaced
- Measurements taken
- Technician name
- Next service due

**Trend Monitoring**

Track over time:
- Positioning accuracy
- Backlash measurements

### Condition-Based Maintenance

**Vibration Monitoring**

Baseline Measurement:
- When robot new or after maintenance
- Measure at each joint

Periodic Checks:

**Current Monitoring**

Normal Operating Current:
- Record baseline for each joint
- Higher current indicates friction or binding
- Lower current may indicate belt slippage

**Temperature Monitoring**

Thermal Camera:

### Firmware Updates

**When to Update**

Good Reasons:
- Bug fixes for known issues
- New features needed
- Security patches

Caution:
- If system working well, consider not updating

- Have rollback plan

**Procedure**

1. Backup everything (programs, configs)
2. Read release notes thoroughly
3. Verify compatibility (robot model, options)
4. Schedule downtime
5. Perform update
6. Test all functions
7. Verify programs run correctly
8. Keep previous firmware available for rollback

### Controller Maintenance
