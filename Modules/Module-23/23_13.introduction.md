# Module 23 – Shop Organization and Management


## Introduction

**"What gets measured gets managed."** - Peter Drucker

**Metrics**: Quantitative measures of performance that track progress toward goals.

**Why Metrics Matter:**

**Without metrics:**
- Operating blind (don't know if improving or declining)
- Opinions dominate (no facts)
- Problems hidden (until they become crises)
- Improvement efforts unfocused (working on wrong things)

**With metrics:**
- Visibility (see performance clearly)
- Objectivity (facts over opinions)
- Focus (prioritize based on data)
- Accountability (know who's responsible)
- Improvement (track progress over time)

**Key Principles:**

1. **Measure what matters**: Focus on metrics that drive business results
2. **Keep it simple**: 5-10 key metrics (not 50)
3. **Make it visible**: Display where people can see (boards, dashboards)
4. **Review regularly**: Daily, weekly, monthly (depending on metric)
5. **Act on data**: Metrics without action are useless
6. **Continuous improvement**: Use metrics to drive improvement

**This section covers:**
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for CNC shops
- Data collection and tracking
- Performance dashboards
- Continuous improvement metrics
- Financial metrics
- Balanced scorecard approach

## 23.13.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for CNC Shops

**KPI (Key Performance Indicator)**: Metric that reflects critical success factors.

### 23.13.1.1 OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness)

**OEE**: Comprehensive measure of equipment productivity.

**Formula:**

```
OEE = Availability × Performance × Quality
```

**Three Components:**

**1. Availability**: % of scheduled time equipment is available to run

```
Availability = (Operating Time / Scheduled Time) × 100%

Operating Time = Scheduled Time - Downtime
```

**Downtime includes:**
- Breakdowns
- Setups/changeovers
- Material shortages
- Tooling issues

**Example:**
- Scheduled time: 8 hours (480 minutes)
- Downtime: 60 minutes (breakdown + setup)
- Operating time: 420 minutes
- **Availability = 420 / 480 = 87.5%**

**2. Performance**: % of maximum speed equipment achieves

```
Performance = (Ideal Cycle Time / Actual Cycle Time) × 100%

or

Performance = (Actual Output / Maximum Possible Output) × 100%
```

**Performance loss from:**
- Running slower than designed speed
- Minor stops and pauses
- Reduced speed (worn tools, operator pace)

**Example:**
- Ideal cycle time: 5 minutes/part
- Actual average cycle time: 6 minutes/part
- **Performance = 5 / 6 = 83.3%**

**3. Quality**: % of parts that meet specifications

```
Quality = (Good Parts / Total Parts) × 100%
```

**Quality loss from:**
- Scrap (parts that can't be salvaged)
- Rework (parts that need additional work)

**Example:**
- Total parts: 70
- Good parts: 67
- Scrap: 2, Rework: 1
- **Quality = 67 / 70 = 95.7%**

**Calculate OEE:**

```
OEE = 87.5% × 83.3% × 95.7%
    = 0.875 × 0.833 × 0.957
    = 69.7%
```

**OEE Benchmarks:**

| OEE | Rating |
|-----|--------|
| < 60% | Poor (typical for many shops) |
| 60-75% | Fair |
| 75-85% | Good |
| 85%+ | World-class |

**Using OEE:**

- **Identify bottlenecks**: Which factor is worst? (focus improvement there)
- **Compare machines**: Which equipment is most/least productive?
- **Track improvement**: Is OEE increasing over time?
- **Set targets**: Goal: Improve 5% per year

**Example Improvement:**

Current: OEE = 70% (Availability 85%, Performance 90%, Quality 92%)

**Worst factor = Availability** (focus here)

**Action:** Reduce setup time (SMED project)
- Setup time reduced from 60 min to 30 min
- New availability: 90%
- New OEE: 90% × 90% × 92% = **74.5%** (6.4% improvement)

### 23.13.1.2 First Pass Yield

**First Pass Yield (FPY)**: % of parts that pass inspection without rework.

**Formula:**

```
FPY = (Parts Passing First Time / Total Parts Inspected) × 100%
```

**Example:**
- Parts inspected: 100
- Passed first time: 95
- Rework: 3
- Scrap: 2
- **FPY = 95 / 100 = 95%**

**Why FPY Matters:**

- **Cost**: Rework consumes labor, machine time, materials
- **Lead Time**: Rework delays delivery
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Consistent quality builds trust
- **Process Capability**: FPY indicates process control

**Targets:**
- **Good**: 95%+
- **Excellent**: 98%+
- **World-Class**: 99%+

**Rolled Throughput Yield (RTY):**

For multi-operation processes, FPY compounds:

```
RTY = FPY₁ × FPY₂ × FPY₃ × ... × FPYₙ
```

**Example: 5-operation process, each 95% FPY:**

```
RTY = 0.95⁵ = 0.774 = 77.4%
```

**Only 77.4% pass all operations first time!** (Even though each op is 95%)

**Implication**: High individual FPY is critical (small improvements compound)

### 23.13.1.3 On-Time Delivery

**On-Time Delivery (OTD)**: % of orders shipped on or before promised date.

**Formula:**

```
OTD = (Orders Delivered On Time / Total Orders) × 100%
```

**Example:**
- Total orders: 50
- Delivered on time: 47
- Late: 3
- **OTD = 47 / 50 = 94%**

**Definition of "On Time":**

Be clear:
- **Ship date** (left facility on time?) or **Receipt date** (customer received on time?)
- **Same day** (on due date) or **Within window** (due date ±1 day?)

**Consistency matters**: Use same definition always.

**Targets:**
- **Acceptable**: 90%+
- **Good**: 95%+
- **Excellent**: 98%+

**Why OTD Matters:**

- **Customer satisfaction**: #1 driver (late = unhappy customer)
- **Competitive advantage**: Reliable delivery wins repeat business
- **Internal efficiency**: High OTD indicates good planning, execution

**Measuring Late Orders:**

Not just % on-time, but **how late**:
- Average days late (for late orders)
- Distribution (1 day late vs. 10 days late)

**Example:**
- 3 late orders: 1 day, 2 days, 5 days late
- Average lateness: (1 + 2 + 5) / 3 = 2.7 days

### 23.13.1.4 Cycle Time

**Cycle Time**: Time to complete one unit (or one operation).

**Formula:**

```
Cycle Time = Time to Produce / Quantity Produced
```

**Example:**
- 10 parts machined in 120 minutes
- **Cycle Time = 120 / 10 = 12 minutes/part**

**Lead Time vs. Cycle Time:**

- **Cycle Time**: Hands-on processing time (value-added)
- **Lead Time**: Total time from order to delivery (includes waiting)

**Example:**
- Cycle time: 2 hours (actual machining)
- Lead time: 2 weeks (includes queuing, inspection, shipping)

**Why Cycle Time Matters:**

- **Capacity**: Lower cycle time → higher throughput
- **Cost**: Faster cycle → lower labor cost per part
- **Flexibility**: Fast cycle time → respond quickly to changes

**Tracking:**
- **Actual vs. Standard**: Are we hitting estimated cycle times?
- **Trend**: Improving (faster) or degrading (slower)?
- **Comparison**: Which setups or operators are fastest? (learn from best)

### 23.13.1.5 Setup Time

**Setup Time (Changeover Time)**: Time to change from producing one part to another.

**Measurement:**

```
Setup Time = Last Good Part of Job A → First Good Part of Job B
```

**Includes:**
- Remove tools, fixtures from Job A
- Install tools, fixtures for Job B
- Program load, offset entry
- First part run, inspection, adjustment

**Why Setup Time Matters:**

- **Flexibility**: Fast setup → can run small batches economically
- **Capacity**: Less setup time → more production time
- **Cost**: Setup is non-productive (no parts made)

**Targets:**

Depends on complexity, but general goal:
- **Single-Minute Exchange of Die (SMED)**: Setup under 10 minutes (ideal)
- **Realistic for CNC**: 15-30 minutes (many shops 45-120 minutes currently)

**Improvement Focus:**

Setup time reduction is high-leverage:
- Reduces batch size requirements (enables one-piece flow)
- Increases capacity (more time producing)
- Improves flexibility (handle variety economically)

**Tracking:**
- Average setup time (by machine, by job type)
- Trend (reducing over time?)
- Best practices (what do fastest setups do differently?)

## 23.13.2 Data Collection and Tracking

**Accurate data is essential** for meaningful metrics.

### Data Collection Methods

**1. Manual Data Entry**

Operators or supervisors record data:
- Paper forms (shop floor travelers, inspection sheets)
- Computer or tablet entry (spreadsheet, database)

**Pros**: Low tech, flexible
**Cons**: Time-consuming, error-prone, easily forgotten

**Best Practices:**
- Simple forms (check boxes, drop-downs)
- Frequent (capture data immediately, not end of shift)
- Training (why it matters, how to record accurately)

**2. Automated Data Capture**

Equipment or systems automatically record data:
- Machine monitoring (CNC control reports cycle time, downtime)
- Barcode/RFID scanning (job start/stop, material tracking)
- Sensors (count parts produced, detect downtime)

**Pros**: Accurate, no manual effort, real-time
**Cons**: Equipment cost, integration complexity

**3. Hybrid Approach** (Most Practical)

- **Automated**: Where feasible (machine hours, part counts)
- **Manual**: Where needed (quality data, reasons for downtime)

### Data Tracking Systems

**1. Spreadsheets (Small Shops)**

- Excel or Google Sheets
- Tabs for each metric
- Manual entry, formulas calculate metrics
- Charts for visualization

**Pros**: Low cost, familiar, flexible
**Cons**: Manual, limited automation, hard to scale

**2. Manufacturing Execution System (MES)**

- Software for shop floor data
- Tracks jobs, machines, operators, quality
- Real-time dashboards
- Integration with ERP, machines

**Pros**: Comprehensive, automated, real-time
**Cons**: Cost ($10k-$100k+), implementation effort

**3. ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)**

- Business management software
- Includes production, inventory, financials
- Metrics module or reporting tools

**Pros**: Integrated with business data
**Cons**: Complexity, cost, may need customization

### Ensuring Data Quality

**1. Define Clearly**

- What exactly to measure (clear definitions)
- When to measure (frequency, timing)
- How to measure (procedure, tools)

**2. Train Everyone**

- Why metrics matter
- How to collect accurately
- Common errors to avoid

**3. Audit Periodically**

- Spot-check data (is it accurate?)
- Compare sources (manual vs. automatic—do they match?)
- Correct errors quickly

**4. Simplify**

- Easy to record (less effort = more compliance)
- Minimal fields (only what's essential)
- Pre-filled options (drop-down menus, not free text)

---

## 23.13.3 Performance Dashboards

**Dashboard**: Visual display of key metrics.

### Dashboard Design Principles

**1. At-a-Glance Understanding**

- See status immediately (not dig through data)
- Visual: Charts, gauges, color-coding

**2. Focus on Key Metrics**

- 5-10 metrics (not 50)
- Most important for current goals

**3. Actionable**

- Link to action (if red, what do we do?)
- Owner identified (who's responsible?)

**4. Current**

- Update frequency matches metric (daily, weekly)
- Real-time if possible

**5. Accessible**

- Visible to relevant people
- Shop floor, management, remote access

### Dashboard Levels

**1. Operator Level (Machine or Cell)**

Focus: Immediate performance

Metrics:
- Parts produced today (vs. target)
- Current cycle time
- Quality issues (scrap count)
- Downtime events

Update: Real-time or hourly

**2. Supervisor Level (Department)**

Focus: Daily/weekly performance

Metrics:
- OEE by machine
- On-time delivery (jobs due this week)
- Quality (FPY, scrap %)

Update: Daily

**3. Management Level (Facility)**

Focus: Strategic performance

Metrics:
- Revenue and profit
- OEE and utilization
- On-time delivery %
- Customer satisfaction
- Safety (incident rate)

Update: Weekly/monthly

### Visualization Types

**1. Numeric Display**

Simple number with trend arrow:

```
On-Time Delivery:  94%  ↑
```

**2. Gauge**

Speedometer-style gauge:

```
    OEE
 ┌───────┐
 │ ░░█░░ │  73%
 └───────┘
 60 75 90
```

**3. Bar Chart**

Compare metrics across machines, time periods:

```
Machine OEE:
Mill-1 ████████░░  82%
Mill-2 ██████░░░░  68%
Lathe-1 █████████░  91%
```

**4. Line Chart**

Trend over time:

```
On-Time Delivery Trend (Last 12 Weeks)
100%─┐
     │    ╱──╲
 95% │  ╱      ╲──╱───
     │╱
 90% └────────────────→
     Jan  Feb  Mar
```

**5. Color Coding**

- **Green**: On target or exceeding
- **Yellow**: Caution (close to target, needs attention)
- **Red**: Below target (action required)

## 23.13.5 Financial Metrics

**Financial metrics** link operational performance to business results.

### 23.13.5.1 Cost per Part

**Cost per Part**: Total cost to produce one part.

**Components:**

1. **Material Cost**: Raw material for one part (including scrap allowance)
2. **Labor Cost**: Direct labor hours × hourly rate (including burden)
3. **Machine Cost**: Machine hourly rate × cycle time
4. **Tooling Cost**: Tool cost ÷ tool life (cost per part for tooling)
5. **Overhead**: Allocated portion of fixed costs

**Example:**

**Part 12345-A:**
- Material: $8.50
- Labor: 0.5 hours × $60/hr = $30.00
- Machine: 0.5 hours × $80/hr = $40.00
- Tooling: $0.80/part
- Overhead: $10.00

**Total Cost per Part = $89.30**

**Use Cost per Part to:**
- Price products (ensure profit margin)
- Compare actual to estimated (cost control)
- Identify cost reduction opportunities (which component is highest?)
- Make/buy decisions (cheaper to make or buy?)

### 23.13.5.2 Machine Utilization

**Machine Utilization**: % of available time machine is used productively.

**Formula:**

```
Utilization = (Productive Time / Available Time) × 100%
```

**Where:**
- **Available Time**: Scheduled production time (e.g., 8 hrs/day)
- **Productive Time**: Time making parts (excludes setup, downtime, idle)

**Example:**
- Available: 480 minutes (8 hours)
- Setup: 40 minutes
- Breakdown: 20 minutes
- Idle (no work): 60 minutes
- Productive: 360 minutes

**Utilization = 360 / 480 = 75%**

**Target Utilization:**

- **70-85%**: Good (allows flexibility, maintenance)
- **> 90%**: May indicate bottleneck (no capacity for growth, maintenance)
- **< 60%**: Underutilized (capacity issue or insufficient work)

**Note**: 100% utilization is not the goal (no buffer for variability, improvement)

### 23.13.5.3 Scrap and Rework Costs

**Scrap Cost**: Value of parts scrapped (cannot be used).

**Rework Cost**: Labor and machine time to fix defective parts.

**Formula:**

```
Scrap Cost = Number of Scrapped Parts × Cost per Part

Rework Cost = Rework Hours × Labor Rate
```

**Example:**

**Monthly Scrap and Rework:**
- Scrap: 50 parts × $89.30 = $4,465
- Rework: 30 hours × $60/hr = $1,800
- **Total Quality Cost = $6,265**

**As % of Revenue:**
- Monthly revenue: $200,000
- **Quality cost % = $6,265 / $200,000 = 3.1%**

**Benchmark**:
- **World-class**: < 1% of revenue
- **Good**: 1-3%
- **Needs improvement**: > 3%

**Track Trend:**
- Reducing? (improvement working)
- Increasing? (process degrading, investigate)

**By Part or Operation:**
- Which parts have highest scrap rate?
- Which operations cause most rework?
- Focus improvement efforts

---

## 23.13.6 Balanced Scorecard Approach

**Balanced Scorecard**: Framework balancing multiple perspectives.

**Four Perspectives:**

### 1. Financial Perspective

**Question**: "How do we look to shareholders/owners?"

**Metrics:**
- Revenue and profit
- Cost per part
- Cash flow
- Return on investment (ROI)

**Goal**: Financial health and growth

### 2. Customer Perspective

**Question**: "How do customers see us?"

**Metrics:**
- On-time delivery
- Quality (defect rate, returns)
- Customer satisfaction (surveys, NPS)
- Order fulfillment time

**Goal**: Customer satisfaction and loyalty

### 3. Internal Process Perspective

**Question**: "What must we excel at?"

**Metrics:**
- OEE
- Cycle time
- Setup time
- Lead time
- Scrap/rework rates

**Goal**: Operational excellence

### 4. Learning and Growth Perspective

**Question**: "Can we continue to improve and create value?"

**Metrics:**
- Employee training hours
- Improvement projects completed
- New capabilities developed
- Employee engagement/turnover

**Goal**: Continuous improvement and innovation

### Using Balanced Scorecard

**Balance**: Don't over-focus on one perspective at expense of others.

**Example of Imbalance:**
- Focus only on financial (cut costs) → quality suffers → lose customers
- Focus only on quality → costs spiral → unprofitable

**Balanced Approach:**
- Strong financial performance
- Satisfied customers
- Efficient processes
- Continuous learning and improvement

**All four support long-term success.**
