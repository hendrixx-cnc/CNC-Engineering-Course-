# Section 26.9 – Vendor and Supplier Management

## Overview

Your vendors and suppliers are critical partners in your business success. The right suppliers provide quality materials at competitive prices, deliver on time, offer technical support, and help you solve problems. Poor supplier relationships lead to material delays, quality issues, cost overruns, and lost customers.

This section covers selecting suppliers, evaluating performance, negotiating effectively, building strong relationships, managing multiple vs. single-source suppliers, conducting performance reviews, and knowing when to change suppliers.

## 9.2 Evaluating Supplier Performance

### 9.2.1 Quality Metrics

**Material Quality:**
- Material to specification (correct alloy, temper, hardness)
- Material certifications accurate and complete
- Consistent quality batch-to-batch
- Defect rate (scratches, dings, out-of-tolerance)

**Tooling Quality:**
- Performance meets expectations (tool life, surface finish, accuracy)
- Defect rate (damaged, out-of-spec tooling)
- Consistency (same part number performs the same)

**Service Quality (Heat Treat, Plating, etc.):**
- Meets specification (hardness, coating thickness, finish)
- Cosmetic quality (appearance, blemishes)
- Rework rate (how often must they redo work?)

**Tracking:**
- Document quality issues (photos, measurements, descriptions)
- Track defect rate by supplier
- Share feedback with supplier (good and bad)

**Acceptable Performance:**
- Material defect rate: <2% (1 in 50 orders)
- Tooling defect rate: <5% (1 in 20 tools)
- Service provider defect rate: <3% (1 in 33 jobs)

### 9.2.2 On-Time Delivery

**Importance:**
On-time delivery from suppliers directly impacts your ability to deliver on time to customers.

**Metrics to Track:**

**On-Time Delivery Rate:**
```
OTD% = (Orders Delivered On-Time ÷ Total Orders) × 100%

Example:
20 orders in month
18 delivered on promised date
2 late
OTD = 18/20 = 90%
```

**Acceptable Performance:**
- Excellent: >95% on-time
- Good: 90-95%
- Acceptable: 85-90%
- Poor: <85% (find alternate supplier)

**Lead Time Accuracy:**
Do they deliver when they say they will?
- Promised 3 days, delivered in 3 days = ✓
- Promised 3 days, delivered in 5 days = ✗

**Communication:**
Do they proactively communicate delays?
- Call/email when delay expected = Good
- You call asking where it is, they say "oh, it's late" = Bad

**Tracking:**
- Log order date, promised date, actual delivery date
- Calculate OTD% monthly or quarterly
- Address chronic late deliveries

### 9.2.3 Price Competitiveness

**Regular Price Comparison:**

**Every 6-12 Months:**
- Get quotes from 2-3 suppliers for commonly purchased items
- Compare pricing (apples-to-apples)
- Identify if current supplier is competitive

**Example:**
```
6061 Aluminum Plate, 1/2" × 12" × 12", Qty 10 pcs

Supplier A (current): $45/pc
Supplier B: $42/pc
Supplier C: $48/pc

Analysis: Current supplier competitive (middle of range)
```

**Price Increase Monitoring:**
- Track prices over time
- Question significant increases (>10%)
- Negotiate or shop around

**Total Cost, Not Just Unit Price:**
Consider:
- Unit price
- Shipping costs
- Minimum order requirements
- Payment terms (Net 30 vs. prepay)
- Quality (cheap price + poor quality = expensive)
- Delivery reliability (late delivery costs you money)

**Value ≠ Lowest Price**

Sometimes paying slightly more for better service is worth it:
- Faster delivery (enables quick-turn jobs)
- Better quality (less scrap, fewer delays)
- Technical support (application help, problem-solving)
- Flexibility (small quantities, custom cutting)

### 9.2.4 Customer Service

**Responsiveness:**
- How quickly do they respond to calls/emails?
- Same day? Next day? Or ignored for days?

**Helpfulness:**
- Do they solve problems or just take orders?
- Willing to go extra mile (rush order, special cutting, technical advice)?

**Accuracy:**
- Do they send what you ordered?
- Invoices accurate?
- Paperwork correct?

**Communication:**
- Proactive about delays or issues?
- Keep you informed?

**Problem Resolution:**
- How do they handle errors or defects?
- Willing to make it right? Or argue and deflect?

**Scoring Customer Service:**

Rate 1-5 on each factor:
- Responsiveness
- Helpfulness
- Accuracy
- Communication
- Problem Resolution

**Total Score / 25:**
- 20-25: Excellent (keep this supplier)
- 15-19: Good (monitor, encourage improvement)
- 10-14: Marginal (consider alternatives)
- <10: Poor (find new supplier)

## 9.3 Negotiating with Vendors

### 9.3.1 Pricing and Payment Terms

**Negotiation Leverage:**

You have more leverage when:
- ✓ High-volume buyer (spend thousands/month)
- ✓ Multiple supplier options (competition)
- ✓ Long-term relationship potential
- ✓ Consistent, predictable orders
- ✓ Cash payment or prompt payment history

You have less leverage when:
- ✗ Small, infrequent orders
- ✗ Limited supplier options (specialty items)
- ✗ Poor payment history
- ✗ Inconsistent needs

**Pricing Negotiation Tactics:**

**1. Volume Discounts:**
```
Request: "I'm currently buying $5,000/month of aluminum from you.
          If I commit to $8,000/month, can you offer a volume discount?"

Result: Negotiate 5-10% discount for higher volume commitment
```

**2. Competitive Quotes:**
```
Approach: Get quotes from 2-3 suppliers, present to preferred supplier:
"I'd like to continue buying from you (relationship, service, etc.),
 but Supplier B is 8% cheaper. Can you match or get close?"

Result: Often can match or come within a few percent
```

**3. Blanket Orders:**
```
Offer: "I'll commit to buying 100 pieces over the next 6 months.
        Can you offer a better price for the commitment?"

Result: Supplier has guaranteed revenue, may discount 5-10%
```

**4. Payment Terms:**
```
Current: Net 30 (payment due in 30 days)
Request: "Can you extend to Net 45 or Net 60 for established customers?"

OR

Request: "Can you offer 2% discount for payment within 10 days (2/10 Net 30)?"
```

**5. Consolidated Suppliers:**
```
Approach: "I'm buying materials from 3 different suppliers.
           If I consolidate all my aluminum purchases with you
           ($10K/month total), what kind of pricing can you offer?"

Result: Larger total spend = more negotiation power
```

**Important:**
- Always be respectful and professional
- Frame as win-win (volume, consistency, partnership)
- Don't lie about competitor quotes (unethical, damages relationship)
- Be willing to walk away if terms don't work

### 9.3.2 Volume Discounts

**Tiered Pricing:**

Most suppliers offer tiered pricing based on quantity:

**Example: 6061 Aluminum Plate**
```
Quantity 1-9 pcs:    $50/pc
Quantity 10-49 pcs:  $45/pc (10% discount)
Quantity 50-99 pcs:  $42/pc (16% discount)
Quantity 100+ pcs:   $40/pc (20% discount)
```

**Strategy:**
- Order in larger quantities when discount justifies it
- Balance discount vs. inventory carrying cost
- Consolidate orders (order monthly instead of weekly)

**Annual Volume Agreements:**

Commit to annual spend in exchange for pricing:

**Example:**
```
Commitment: $50,000 annual spend on aluminum
Discount: 12% off list price on all orders
Terms: Quarterly review, adjusted if volume not met
```

**Advantages:**
- ✓ Predictable pricing (budget stability)
- ✓ Better pricing (volume commitment)
- ✓ Priority service (valued customer)

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ Locked into one supplier
- ✗ Must meet volume commitment (or lose discount)

### 9.3.3 Consignment Arrangements

**Consignment:** Supplier places inventory at your location. You only pay for what you use.

**How It Works:**
```
1. Supplier provides tooling cabinet stocked with endmills, drills, etc.
2. You use tools as needed from cabinet
3. Supplier reps visit monthly, restock cabinet
4. You're invoiced only for tools used
```

**Advantages:**
- ✓ No upfront inventory cost (better cash flow)
- ✓ Always have tools in stock (no waiting for orders)
- ✓ Supplier manages inventory (automatic restocking)
- ✓ Often includes volume discount pricing

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ Limited to what supplier stocks (may not have every tool you need)
- ✗ Committed to one supplier for those items
- ✗ Pricing may be higher than shopping around

**When It Makes Sense:**
- Medium to large shops (high tool consumption)
- Standard tooling needs (common drills, endmills)
- Value convenience and availability over absolute lowest price

**Negotiating Consignment:**
- Minimum monthly usage requirement (supplier wants volume)
- Pricing (should include volume discount)
- Restocking frequency (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly)
- Tool variety (ensure they stock what you need)

### 9.3.4 Blanket Orders and Contracts

**Blanket Purchase Order (BPO):**

Agreement to purchase specified quantity over time period at agreed price.

**Example:**
```
Blanket PO: 500 pcs 6061-T6 Plate, 1/2" × 12" × 24"
Price: $65/pc
Duration: 12 months
Release: Call off quantities as needed (minimum 25 pcs per release)
```

**Advantages:**
- ✓ Locked-in pricing (protection against price increases)
- ✓ Guaranteed availability (supplier reserves stock)
- ✓ Volume discount (committed quantity)
- ✓ Flexibility (call off as needed)
- ✓ Reduced paperwork (one PO, multiple releases)

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ Commitment (must buy quantity or pay penalty)
- ✗ Locked in (can't switch suppliers easily)
- ✗ Price risk (if market prices drop, you're locked in higher)

**When to Use:**
- Production jobs (known quantity over time)
- Stable demand (confident you'll use material)
- Price protection (material costs rising)

**Annual Contracts:**

Comprehensive agreement covering:
- Pricing (fixed or formula-based)
- Volume commitments
- Payment terms
- Delivery expectations
- Quality standards
- Review and renewal terms

**Best For:**
- Large shops with consistent, high-volume needs
- Strategic supplier relationships
- Cost certainty and budgeting

## 9.4 Building Supplier Relationships

**Relationships Matter:**

Strong supplier relationships provide:
- Better pricing and terms
- Priority service (rush orders, allocation during shortages)
- Flexibility (custom cutting, small quantities, returns)
- Problem solving (technical support, material substitutions)
- Advance notice (price increases, supply issues, new products)

**How to Build Strong Relationships:**

**1. Be a Good Customer:**
- **Pay on time** (or early) - most important factor
- Communicate clearly (specifications, quantities, dates)
- Be reasonable (don't expect miracles, don't abuse rush service)
- Give advance notice when possible (large orders, special needs)

**2. Consolidate Purchases:**
- Give more business to fewer suppliers (you become important customer)
- Suppliers prioritize customers who drive significant revenue

**3. Communicate Regularly:**
- Update them on your business (growth, new capabilities, customer wins)
- Forecast your needs (helps them plan)
- Provide feedback (quality, service, pricing)

**4. Meet in Person:**
- Visit supplier facilities (understand their operation)
- Invite reps to your shop (see how you use their products)
- Attend supplier events (training, open houses)

**5. Be Professional:**
- Respectful communication
- Don't bad-mouth or threaten
- Handle issues constructively

**6. Give Credit Where Due:**
- Thank them for good service
- Provide testimonials or references when appropriate
- Recommend to other shops

**7. Understand Their Business:**
- They have costs, constraints, and challenges too
- Reasonable profit is fair (they need to stay in business)
- Win-win mindset (not adversarial)

**Example Good Relationship:**
```
You've been buying from Supplier A for 3 years.
- You spend $5,000/month consistently
- You pay Net 30 invoices on day 28-30 (never late)
- You call rep once/month to catch up and forecast needs
- You visited their facility once

Result:
- They give you 10% volume discount
- Rush orders get prioritized (same-day pickup when needed)
- They call you first when they get surplus material (deep discounts)
- Sales rep goes to bat for you (extends credit, negotiates price, etc.)
```

## 9.5 Managing Multiple Suppliers vs. Single Source

**Single Source Strategy:**

**Description:** Buy most/all of a category from one supplier.

**Advantages:**
- ✓ Volume leverage (bigger customer = better pricing and service)
- ✓ Simplified management (one contact, one invoice, one relationship)
- ✓ Stronger relationship (you're important to them)
- ✓ Efficiency (less time shopping around)

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ Dependency risk (if they fail, you're stuck)
- ✗ Complacency risk (no competition, service may decline)
- ✗ Supply chain risk (their disruption is your disruption)

**Multiple Source Strategy:**

**Description:** Spread purchases across 2-3+ suppliers per category.

**Advantages:**
- ✓ Competition (keeps suppliers sharp on price and service)
- ✓ Redundancy (if one fails, others available)
- ✓ Broader capabilities (access to different strengths)
- ✓ Leverage (play off each other for better deals)

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ Less volume per supplier (less leverage)
- ✗ More complexity (multiple contacts, invoices, relationships)
- ✗ Time-consuming (shopping, comparing, managing)

**Recommended Hybrid Approach:**

**Primary + Secondary Strategy:**

**Primary Supplier (60-70% of spend):**
- Gets bulk of your business
- Best pricing and terms (volume leverage)
- Strongest relationship
- First call for needs

**Secondary Supplier (20-30% of spend):**
- Backup source (redundancy)
- Competition (keeps primary honest)
- Overflow (when primary can't meet need)
- Specialty items (primary doesn't carry)

**Spot Suppliers (10% of spend):**
- One-off needs
- Emergency situations
- Unique items

**Example:**
```
ALUMINUM:
Primary: Local supplier (70% of aluminum spend)
         - Best pricing due to volume
         - Weekly pickups
         - Strong relationship

Secondary: National distributor (20%)
           - Quick-turn items (overnight ship)
           - Specialty alloys primary doesn't stock
           - Backup when primary out of stock

Spot: Online metals (10%)
      - Odd sizes or small quantities
      - Convenience items
```

## 9.7 When to Change Suppliers

**Valid Reasons to Change:**

**1. Consistent Poor Performance:**
- Chronic late deliveries (OTD <85%)
- Frequent quality issues (defect rate >5%)
- Unresponsive customer service
- Repeated invoice errors

**2. Uncompetitive Pricing:**
- Significantly higher than market (>10-15%)
- Refuses to negotiate despite volume
- Hidden fees or charges

**3. Business Changes:**
- Supplier no longer carries what you need
- Minimum orders too high for your volume
- Changed ownership/management, service declined
- Going out of business or financially unstable

**4. Better Options Available:**
- New supplier offers significantly better value (price + service)
- Supplier closer to you (reduce shipping, lead time)
- Better capabilities (technical support, inventory, etc.)

**Invalid Reasons (Don't Change):**

**1. Slight Price Difference:**
- Switching for 2-3% savings (relationship and service worth more)
- Unless price difference is significant (>10%)

**2. One-Time Issues:**
- Everybody has a bad day (late delivery, error)
- Address issue, give them chance to improve
- Don't overreact to isolated incidents

**3. Greener Grass Syndrome:**
- Constantly switching, never building relationships
- Costs you leverage and priority service

**How to Change Suppliers:**

**1. Identify Replacement:**
- Research alternatives (2-3 options)
- Test with small orders (verify quality, service)
- Negotiate pricing and terms

**2. Transition Plan:**
- Don't burn bridges (maintain backup relationship)
- Gradual transition (shift 50%, then 100% if satisfied)
- Give current supplier opportunity to match (if relationship worth saving)

**3. Communicate Professionally:**
```
Example:
"We've appreciated your service over the years. However, our business needs
have changed and we're consolidating suppliers. We'll be reducing orders with
you but may still place occasional orders. Thank you for your support."

OR (if they were poor):
"We've experienced consistent issues with delivery and quality despite multiple
discussions. We've decided to move our business to another supplier. We
appreciate your past service."
```

**4. Don't Burn Bridges:**
- Industry is small (reputation matters)
- May need them again (backup, specialty items)
- Professional courtesy

## Conclusion

Vendor and supplier relationships are critical to your business success. The right suppliers provide quality products, competitive pricing, reliable delivery, and valuable support. Poor suppliers cause delays, quality problems, and lost customers.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Select Suppliers Strategically:** Evaluate based on quality, price, delivery, service, and relationship potential. Don't just choose cheapest.

2. **Build Strong Relationships:** Pay on time, communicate well, consolidate purchases, be professional. Strong relationships provide better pricing, priority service, and problem-solving support.

3. **Use Primary + Secondary Strategy:** Give majority of business to primary supplier (volume leverage), maintain secondary for backup and competition.

4. **Track Performance:** Measure on-time delivery, quality, pricing, and service. Conduct formal reviews quarterly or semi-annually.

5. **Negotiate Effectively:** Use volume, competition, and relationship to negotiate better pricing, terms, and service. Frame as win-win.

6. **Know When to Change:** Poor performance, uncompetitive pricing, or better options justify change. Don't change over minor issues.

7. **Pay On Time:** Single most important factor in supplier relationships. Pay invoices promptly, builds trust and priority.

8. **Communicate Proactively:** Forecast needs, provide feedback, share your business plans. Helps suppliers serve you better.

9. **Professional Always:** Even when changing suppliers or addressing problems, maintain professional courtesy. Industry is small, reputation matters.

10. **Value = Price + Service:** Cheapest isn't always best. Factor delivery speed, quality, technical support, and flexibility into value equation.

Your suppliers are partners in your success. Treat them well, manage them professionally, and they'll help you grow a profitable business.
