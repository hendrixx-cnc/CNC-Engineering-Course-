# Module 5 – Plasma Cutting

## 10. Cut Quality Optimization: Pierce Strategy, Feed Rate, and Dross Minimization

### 10.1 Defining Cut Quality: Metrics and Acceptance Criteria

Plasma cut quality encompasses multiple measurable parameters that determine whether a part requires secondary finishing (grinding, machining) or can be used as-cut. **Optimizing cut quality** balances these parameters against production speed and consumable cost to meet application requirements at minimum total cost.

**Primary Cut Quality Metrics:**

1. **Kerf Width:** The width of material removed by the cutting process. Narrower kerf improves material utilization (nesting efficiency) and dimensional accuracy but requires lower current (slower cutting).

2. **Edge Squareness (Bevel Angle):** The deviation from 90° perpendicular between the cut edge and workpiece surface. Plasma cuts exhibit characteristic top-edge rounding and slight taper (typically 1–5° on the drag side).

3. **Dross Formation:** Molten metal that solidifies on the bottom edge of the cut. Acceptable dross is minimal and easily removable by hand; excessive dross requires grinding (adds cost and time).

4. **Surface Roughness (Ra):** The arithmetic average of surface height deviations. Plasma-cut edges typically achieve Ra = 6–25 μm (comparable to oxy-fuel, inferior to laser at Ra = 3–10 μm).

5. **Top Edge Quality:** Rounding or melting at the top edge caused by arc attachment and heat input. Minimized through proper lead-in strategy and standoff control.

**ISO 9013 Quality Grades:**

International standard ISO 9013 classifies thermal cut quality into five grades (Range 1–5), with Range 1 being the highest quality:

| Quality Grade | Perpendicularity Tolerance (u) | Surface Roughness (Rz5) | Typical Application |
|---------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Range 1** | u ≤ 0.05 + 0.003·e | Rz5 ≤ 90 μm | Precision parts, no secondary finishing |
| **Range 2** | u ≤ 0.10 + 0.006·e | Rz5 ≤ 130 μm | General fabrication, minimal finishing |
| **Range 3** | u ≤ 0.20 + 0.012·e | Rz5 ≤ 180 μm | Structural parts, accept grinding |
| **Range 4** | u ≤ 0.30 + 0.020·e | Rz5 ≤ 250 μm | Rough cutting, significant finishing required |
| **Range 5** | u > Range 4 limits | Rz5 > 250 μm | Demolition, scrap processing |

where:
- $u$ = perpendicularity tolerance (mm)
- $e$ = material thickness (mm)
- $Rz5$ = mean peak-to-valley roughness (μm)

**Typical plasma cutting achieves Range 2–3** with optimized parameters; Range 1 requires high-definition plasma (HDP) systems.

### 10.2 Pierce Strategy and Lead-In Geometry

The pierce (arc start on solid material) represents the most violent phase of plasma cutting. The arc dwells at one location, creating a localized melt pool and potential defects (oversize hole, excessive HAZ, spatter). **Proper pierce strategy** prevents these defects from contaminating the finished part.

**Pierce Delay Calculation:**

Pierce delay $t_{\text{pierce}}$ must allow complete material penetration before motion begins:

$$t_{\text{pierce}} = \frac{e}{v_{\text{penetration}}} + t_{\text{margin}}$$

where:
- $e$ = material thickness (mm)
- $v_{\text{penetration}}$ = penetration rate (3–6 mm/s for steel, varies with amperage)
- $t_{\text{margin}}$ = safety margin (0.5–1.0 s to ensure full penetration)

**Example 10.1: Pierce Delay for 12 mm Steel**

**Given:**
- Material thickness: $e = 12$ mm
- Penetration rate: $v_{\text{penetration}} = 4.5$ mm/s (typical for 85 A)
- Safety margin: $t_{\text{margin}} = 0.8$ s

**Calculate pierce delay:**

$$t_{\text{pierce}} = \frac{12}{4.5} + 0.8 = 2.67 + 0.8 = 3.47 \text{ s}$$

**Programming:** Set pierce delay to 3.5 seconds in G-code or CNC parameters.

**Lead-In Geometry:**

To prevent the pierce hole from appearing on the finished part, the torch must pierce **outside the part boundary** and then move into the cut path. The **lead-in** is a curved or linear path connecting the pierce point to the cut contour.

**Lead-In Types:**

1. **Linear Lead-In:** Straight line from pierce point to cut path. Simple but can leave witness mark at entry point.

2. **Arc Lead-In:** Tangent arc (radius = 3–10 mm) smoothly merges into cut path. Produces cleanest entry with minimal witness mark.

3. **Loop Lead-In:** Full circular loop (radius = 5–15 mm) before entering cut. Best quality but consumes additional material and pierce.

**Lead-In Length Selection:**

$$L_{\text{lead}} = k \cdot e$$

where:
- $L_{\text{lead}}$ = lead-in length (mm)
- $k = 0.75$–1.5 (multiplier; use 1.0 for general purpose)
- $e$ = material thickness (mm)

For 12 mm steel: $L_{\text{lead}} = 1.0 \times 12 = 12$ mm minimum lead-in length.

**Pierce Location Optimization:**

Pierce in **scrap regions** whenever possible:
- **Interior cutouts:** Pierce inside the cutout (scrap) rather than on the parent sheet
- **Common-line cutting:** When two parts share an edge, pierce between them (kerf becomes scrap)
- **Corner piercing:** Never pierce at sharp corners (creates stress concentration); pierce on straight section ≥2× lead-in length from corner

### 10.3 Cut Speed Optimization: The Speed-Quality Trade-Off

Cut speed (feed rate) profoundly affects cut quality, consumable life, and production cost. **Excessive speed** causes incomplete severance (top-edge melting, heavy dross); **insufficient speed** wastes time and increases heat input (wider HAZ, more edge rounding).

**Optimal Cut Speed Determination:**

Manufacturers provide cut charts specifying recommended feed rate $v_{\text{cut}}$ as a function of material thickness $e$ and current $I$. Empirical approximation for mild steel with air plasma:

$$v_{\text{cut}} = \frac{k \cdot I}{e^{1.3}}$$

where:
- $v_{\text{cut}}$ = cut speed (mm/min)
- $k = 400$–600 (empirical constant, varies by system)
- $I$ = arc current (A)
- $e$ = material thickness (mm)

**Example 10.2: Cut Speed for 85 A, 10 mm Steel**

**Given:**
- Arc current: $I = 85$ A
- Thickness: $e = 10$ mm
- System constant: $k = 500$

**Calculate optimal cut speed:**

$$v_{\text{cut}} = \frac{500 \times 85}{10^{1.3}} = \frac{42,500}{19.95} = 2,130 \text{ mm/min}$$

**Practical Setting:** Set feed rate to 2,100 mm/min (rounded for programming convenience).

**Speed Adjustment for Quality:**

- **High-quality cutting (Range 1–2):** Reduce speed to **80–90%** of optimal (e.g., 1,900 mm/min for above example). Allows more time for molten metal evacuation, reduces dross and bevel.

- **High-speed cutting (Range 3–4):** Increase speed to **110–120%** of optimal (e.g., 2,400 mm/min). Accepts heavier dross and increased bevel for maximum productivity.

**Visual Indicators of Speed Errors:**

| Symptom | Cause | Correction |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Heavy dross on bottom edge | Speed too high (incomplete severance) | Reduce speed 10–20% |
| Excessive top-edge rounding | Speed too low (excessive heat input) | Increase speed 10–20% |
| Arc lag (angled kerf) | Speed too high for current | Reduce speed or increase current |
| Wide kerf, excessive HAZ | Speed too low | Increase speed |

### 10.4 Kerf Compensation and Dimensional Accuracy

The plasma kerf removes material width $w_{\text{kerf}}$, affecting final part dimensions. **Kerf compensation** offsets the programmed tool path by half the kerf width to achieve target dimensions.

**Kerf Width Estimation:**

$$w_{\text{kerf}} = k_{\text{kerf}} \cdot d_{\text{orifice}}$$

where:
- $w_{\text{kerf}}$ = kerf width (mm)
- $k_{\text{kerf}} = 1.3$–1.8 (typical range; smaller for high-quality cuts, larger for thick material)
- $d_{\text{orifice}}$ = nozzle orifice diameter (mm)

For typical 85 A nozzle with $d_{\text{orifice}} = 1.0$ mm:

$$w_{\text{kerf}} = 1.5 \times 1.0 = 1.5 \text{ mm}$$

**CAM Software Compensation:**

Most CAM packages (SheetCAM, Mach3, LinuxCNC with PyCAM) support automatic kerf compensation:

1. **Outside contours (part perimeter):** Offset tool path **outward** by $\frac{w_{\text{kerf}}}{2}$ (torch center moves 0.75 mm outside programmed line)

2. **Inside contours (holes, pockets):** Offset tool path **inward** by $\frac{w_{\text{kerf}}}{2}$ (torch center moves 0.75 mm inside programmed line)

3. **On-line (center cut):** No compensation; torch follows programmed path exactly (use for reference lines, alignment marks)

**Empirical Kerf Calibration:**

To determine actual kerf width for your system:
1. Cut a test square (e.g., 100 mm × 100 mm nominal) with no kerf compensation
2. Measure actual dimensions with calipers
3. Calculate kerf: $w_{\text{kerf}} = \frac{\text{Nominal} - \text{Actual}}{2}$
4. Enter measured kerf into CAM software

**Example:** Programmed 100.0 mm square measures 98.8 mm → $w_{\text{kerf}} = \frac{100.0 - 98.8}{2} = 0.6$ mm per side = **1.2 mm total kerf width**

### 10.5 Dross Formation Mechanisms and Mitigation

Dross (solidified molten metal on the cut bottom edge) is the primary plasma cut quality defect. Understanding formation mechanisms enables targeted mitigation.

**Dross Formation Physics:**

As the plasma jet penetrates the workpiece, molten metal flows downward (gravity + jet momentum). Ideally, all molten metal is expelled from the kerf. **Dross forms when:**

1. **Insufficient exit velocity:** Cutting too slowly allows molten metal to solidify before clearing the kerf
2. **Excessive material thickness:** Thicker material increases melt volume; drag (bottom of kerf) cools slower than top
3. **Low gas pressure:** Reduces jet momentum, insufficient to blow out molten metal
4. **Worn consumables:** Enlarged nozzle orifice reduces gas velocity and arc focus

**Dross Reduction Strategies:**

**1. Optimize Standoff Distance:**

Standoff (torch-to-work distance) affects arc length and energy distribution. **Too high:** arc spreads, reduces kerf penetration (causes dross). **Too low:** arc impinges on top surface, excessive top-edge melting.

**Optimal standoff:** 1.5–2.5 mm for most applications. Use THC (Torch Height Control) to maintain constant standoff during cutting.

**2. Increase Cut Speed (Within Limits):**

Faster cutting reduces heat input per unit length, less molten metal to evacuate. However, excessive speed causes incomplete severance (heavy dross). **Sweet spot:** 90–100% of manufacturer-recommended speed.

**3. Ensure Adequate Gas Pressure:**

Verify gas pressure at torch inlet (not just at regulator). Pressure drop in long hoses reduces actual pressure. **Minimum:** 4.5 bar at torch for reliable dross-free cutting; **optimal:** 5.5–6.0 bar.

**4. Maintain Sharp Consumables:**

Worn nozzle orifice (>15% enlargement) significantly increases dross. Replace consumables proactively based on pierce count (see Section 5.6).

**5. Use Appropriate Gas Type:**

For mild steel:
- **Oxygen plasma gas:** Exothermic reaction with iron adds heat, improves thick-section cutting, reduces dross
- **Air plasma gas:** Lower cost, adequate for ≤12 mm steel, slightly more dross than O₂
- **Nitrogen plasma gas:** For stainless steel and aluminum (prevents nitride formation in steel)

### 10.6 Edge Bevel Control and Perpendicularity

Plasma cuts exhibit characteristic bevel (deviation from 90° edge) due to arc deflection, gas flow dynamics, and torch motion. **Minimizing bevel** improves fit-up for welding and reduces secondary machining.

**Bevel Angle Measurement:**

$$\alpha_{\text{bevel}} = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{w_{\text{top}} - w_{\text{bottom}}}{2e}\right)$$

where:
- $\alpha_{\text{bevel}}$ = bevel angle (degrees from vertical)
- $w_{\text{top}}$ = kerf width at top surface (mm)
- $w_{\text{bottom}}$ = kerf width at bottom surface (mm)
- $e$ = material thickness (mm)

**Typical Values:** Standard plasma cutting produces 1–5° bevel; high-definition plasma achieves 0–2° bevel.

**Bevel Reduction Techniques:**

1. **Reduce cut speed:** Lower speed allows more time for arc penetration, reduces lag angle (primary cause of bevel)

2. **Increase amperage (if within thickness capacity):** Higher current provides more penetrating power, reduces arc deflection

3. **Optimize torch alignment:** Ensure torch is perpendicular to workpiece (check with machinist's square). Even 1° torch tilt translates to 1–2° bevel amplification.

4. **Use bevel compensation software:** Advanced CNC controls can tilt the torch (for 5-axis bevel heads) or offset the path to counteract typical bevel direction

### 10.7 Corner Management and Path Optimization

Sharp corners present challenges: the torch must decelerate to maintain cut quality, but excessive slowdown wastes time. **Corner management algorithms** balance speed and quality.

**Corner Slowdown Strategy:**

At sharp corners (<90° included angle), reduce feed rate to prevent:
- **Arc lag:** Straight-line motion inertia causes arc to lag behind torch at corners, creating incomplete cut or radius instead of sharp corner
- **Consumable damage:** Rapid direction change creates lateral forces on torch mount

**Corner Speed Calculation:**

$$v_{\text{corner}} = v_{\text{cut}} \times \left(\frac{\theta}{180°}\right)^{0.5}$$

where:
- $v_{\text{corner}}$ = corner feed rate (mm/min)
- $v_{\text{cut}}$ = straight-line cut speed (mm/min)
- $\theta$ = interior angle at corner (degrees)

**Example:** For 90° corner with $v_{\text{cut}} = 2,000$ mm/min:

$$v_{\text{corner}} = 2,000 \times \left(\frac{90}{180}\right)^{0.5} = 2,000 \times 0.707 = 1,414 \text{ mm/min}$$

**Implementation:** CNC controllers with "look-ahead" (e.g., LinuxCNC, Mach4) automatically decelerate before corners based on programmed tolerance. Manual setting: reduce feed rate override to 60–70% when approaching sharp corners.

**Corner Overcut (Radius Addition):**

For very sharp corners (<45°), plasma arc width prevents true sharp point. CAM software can add **corner loops**:
- Small circular arc (radius = 1–3 mm) at corner apex
- Torch dwells momentarily to "burn through" corner completely
- Achieves sharper corner than simple slowdown

### 10.8 Multi-Pass Cutting for Thick Sections

When material thickness approaches maximum capacity for the amperage rating, **multi-pass cutting** improves quality by reducing heat input per pass.

**Two-Pass Strategy:**
1. **First pass:** Cut at 80% of maximum speed, prioritize penetration
2. **Second pass:** Offset path inward 0.5–1.0 mm, cut at 100% speed to clean up dross and refine edge

**Advantages:**
- Reduces dross on thick material (>80% of max capacity)
- Improves perpendicularity (second pass corrects first-pass bevel)
- Extends consumable life (avoids maximum-stress single-pass operation)

**Disadvantages:**
- Doubles cutting time for affected edges
- Increases consumable wear (two arc starts per edge)

**Application:** Use selectively on critical edges (weld prep surfaces, precision-fit interfaces) while single-pass cutting non-critical edges.

### 10.9 Process Monitoring and Adaptive Control

**Arc Voltage Monitoring:**

Arc voltage correlates with torch standoff (via arc length). Monitoring voltage during cutting detects:
- **Voltage increase:** Torch rising (standoff increasing) → reduce Z-height
- **Voltage decrease:** Torch lowering (standoff decreasing) → increase Z-height

THC (Torch Height Control) systems implement closed-loop voltage feedback (see Section 5.5).

**Adaptive Feed Rate Control:**

Advanced systems adjust feed rate in real-time based on arc voltage stability:
- **Stable voltage:** Increase speed toward maximum (within quality limits)
- **Voltage fluctuation:** Reduce speed to stabilize arc (prevents loss of cut)

**Piercing Success Detection:**

Monitor time to "Arc OK" signal (transfer detection). Excessive time (>3 s) indicates:
- Insufficient pierce delay (increase delay by 0.5–1.0 s)
- Low gas pressure (check regulator and line pressure)
- Worn consumables (inspect electrode and nozzle)

### 10.10 Summary and Best Practices

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Pierce outside part boundaries:** Use arc lead-ins (length = 1× thickness) to prevent pierce defects on finished parts. Pierce in scrap regions whenever possible.

2. **Optimize cut speed for quality grade:** Use manufacturer charts as baseline; reduce to 80–90% for high quality (Range 1–2), increase to 110–120% for maximum productivity (Range 3–4).

3. **Calibrate kerf compensation:** Measure actual kerf width via test cuts; enter into CAM software for accurate part dimensions. Typical kerf = 1.3–1.8× nozzle orifice diameter.

4. **Control dross through parameter optimization:** Maintain 5.5–6.0 bar gas pressure, optimize standoff (1.5–2.5 mm), use sharp consumables (<15% orifice wear), select appropriate plasma gas (O₂ for steel ≥12 mm).

5. **Manage corners with adaptive slowdown:** Reduce feed rate to 60–70% at sharp corners (<90°) to prevent arc lag and incomplete cutting. Use corner loops for very sharp angles (<45°).

6. **Monitor arc voltage for process stability:** Implement THC for automated standoff control; track voltage trends to detect consumable wear and process drift.

Systematic optimization of pierce strategy, feed rate, kerf compensation, and dross mitigation enables plasma cutting to achieve ISO 9013 Range 2–3 quality suitable for direct use in fabrication without secondary finishing.
