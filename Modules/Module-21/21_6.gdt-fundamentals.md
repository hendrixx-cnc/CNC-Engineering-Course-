# Module 21 – Metrology and Precision Measurement


Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) is a symbolic language used on engineering drawings to define the allowable variation in part geometry. It provides a precise, unambiguous method for specifying design intent and inspection criteria.

## 21.6.1 GD&T Fundamentals

### Why GD&T?

**Traditional Plus/Minus Tolerancing Limitations**:

- Ambiguous: Multiple interpretations possible
- Restrictive: Square tolerance zones waste manufacturing capability
- Incomplete: Doesn't address form, orientation, or location of features
- No datum precedence: Doesn't specify which surfaces establish reference frame

**GD&T Advantages**:

- **Precise**: Unambiguous communication of design requirements
- **Functional**: Tolerances reflect actual part function
- **Economical**: Larger tolerance zones where possible
- **International**: Standardized symbols understood globally
- **Inspection-friendly**: Clear measurement criteria

### Basic GD&T Concepts

**Feature**: A specific portion of a part (surface, hole, slot, etc.)

**Feature of Size**: A feature with opposed points (cylinder, sphere, parallel planes)

**Tolerance Zone**: The boundary within which a feature must lie

**Datum**: A theoretically exact reference (plane, axis, or point) from which measurements are made

**Datum Feature**: The actual feature on the part used to establish the datum

**Material Condition**: The size of a feature of size (Maximum, Least, or Regardless)

### GD&T Symbol Structure

**Feature Control Frame**:

A rectangular box divided into compartments containing:

```
|  Symbol  |  Tolerance  |  Datum A  |  Datum B  |  Datum C  |
```

Example: `| ⌖ | Ø 0.010 Ⓜ | A | B Ⓜ | C Ⓜ |`

This means: Position tolerance of Ø0.010" at MMC, relative to datums A, B at MMC, and C at MMC.

## 21.6.2 Datums and Datum Reference Frames

Datums establish the coordinate system for measurement. Proper datum selection is critical for functional parts.

### Datum Feature Selection

**Primary Datum** (First in sequence):
- Constrains 3 degrees of freedom (typically a plane)
- Usually the largest, most stable mating surface
- Establishes orientation

**Secondary Datum** (Second in sequence):
- Constrains 2 additional degrees of freedom
- Perpendicular to primary (or at specified angle)
- Establishes additional orientation constraint

**Tertiary Datum** (Third in sequence):
- Constrains final degree of freedom
- Completes 6-degree constraint (3 translations, 3 rotations)
- Prevents rotation about secondary datum axis

### Datum Feature Simulators

**Datum simulators** are the physical reference surfaces/axes used during inspection:

**Plane Datum**: Surface plate or precision angle plate

**Cylindrical Datum**: Precision pin or expanding mandrel

**Width Datum**: Parallel blocks or vise jaws

### Datum Precedence

Datum order matters! A-B-C is different from A-C-B.

Example: Mounting bracket
- **Datum A**: Mounting surface (plane) – how it attaches
- **Datum B**: Dowel pin hole (axis) – prevents rotation
- **Datum C**: Edge surface (plane) – prevents sliding

### Datum Targets

For irregular or non-planar surfaces, datum targets specify exact contact points.

**Datum Target Symbols**:
- Point: Single contact point
- Line: Contact along a line
- Area: Contact over defined area (circle or rectangle)

**Application**: Cast or forged parts with rough surfaces

---

## 21.6.3 Form Tolerances

Form tolerances control the shape of individual features without reference to datums.

### Flatness

**Symbol**: ⏥

**Definition**: All points on the surface must lie between two parallel planes separated by the tolerance value.

**Tolerance Zone**: Two parallel planes

**Example**: `⏥ 0.005` means the surface must lie within 0.005" wide zone

**Measurement**:
- Place part on surface plate
- Use height gage with indicator
- Measure high and low points
- Flatness error = maximum variation

**Refinement of**:  Refines the size tolerance of a width feature (doesn't require datum)

### Straightness

**Symbol**: —

**Definition**: A line element on a surface must lie between two parallel lines separated by the tolerance value.

**Two Applications**:

**Surface Straightness**: `— 0.003`
- Applies to surface elements
- Tolerance zone: Two parallel lines
- Checked using straightedge and feeler gage

**Axis Straightness**: `Ø 0.005` (cylindrical tolerance zone)
- Applies to axis of cylindrical feature
- Tolerance zone: Cylinder of diameter 0.005"
- Allows feature to bow within tolerance

**Measurement**: Indicator sweep along surface or between centers for axis

### Circularity (Roundness)

**Symbol**: ○

**Definition**: All points on a circular feature at any cross-section must lie between two concentric circles separated by the tolerance value (radial).

**Tolerance Zone**: Two concentric circles

**Example**: `○ 0.002` means the radius variation cannot exceed 0.002" at any cross-section

**Measurement**:
- Rotate part on precision spindle
- Indicator records radial variation
- Maximum variation = circularity error
- Or measure on roundness tester

**Not**: Circularity does NOT control cylindricity (cross-sections can be parallel but offset)

### Cylindricity

**Symbol**: ⌭

**Definition**: All points on a cylindrical surface must lie between two coaxial cylinders separated by the tolerance value (radial).

**Tolerance Zone**: Two coaxial cylinders

**Example**: `⌭ 0.003` means the entire surface must lie within 0.003" radial zone

**Controls**:
- Straightness of elements
- Circularity of cross-sections
- Taper
- Out-of-round at any section

**Measurement**: CMM or cylindricity tester measuring helical or grid pattern

**Strictest control**: Most restrictive of all form controls

---

## 21.6.4 Orientation Tolerances

Orientation tolerances control angularity of features relative to datums.

### Perpendicularity

**Symbol**: ⊥

**Definition**: A feature must be 90° to a datum within the specified tolerance.

**Tolerance Zone**: Two parallel planes perpendicular to datum

**Example**: `⊥ 0.005 A` means surface must be perpendicular to datum A within 0.005" wide zone

**Applications**:
- Surface perpendicular to datum plane
- Axis perpendicular to datum plane
- Axis perpendicular to datum axis

**Measurement**:
- Establish datum on surface plate
- Indicator sweep perpendicular to datum
- Maximum variation = perpendicularity error

### Parallelism

**Symbol**: ∥

**Definition**: A feature must be parallel to a datum within the specified tolerance.

**Tolerance Zone**: Two parallel planes parallel to datum

**Example**: `∥ 0.003 A` means surface must be parallel to datum A within 0.003" wide zone

**Applications**:
- Mating surfaces
- Bearing mounts
- Precision ways

**Measurement**:
- Establish datum on surface plate
- Height gage with indicator
- Measure high and low points
- Variation = parallelism error

### Angularity

**Symbol**: ∠

**Definition**: A feature must be at a specified angle to a datum within the tolerance.

**Tolerance Zone**: Two parallel planes at specified angle to datum

**Example**: `∠ 0.008 A` at 45° means surface must be within 0.008" zone at 45° to datum A

**Measurement**:
- Establish datum
- Use precision angle block or sine plate
- Indicator measures variation

---

## 21.6.5 Location Tolerances

Location tolerances control the position of features relative to datums or other features.

### Position

**Symbol**: ⌖

**Definition**: A feature's location must be within a tolerance zone centered at the theoretically exact (true) position.

**Tolerance Zone**:
- Cylindrical (for holes, pins): `⌖ Ø 0.010 A B C`
- Width (for slots, tabs): `⌖ 0.010 A B C` (two parallel planes)

**True Position**: The theoretically exact location defined by basic dimensions (boxed dimensions on drawing)

**Formula** (for holes):
```
Position error = 2 × √((X_actual - X_true)² + (Y_actual - Y_true)²)
```

**Example**: Hole at true position X0.000, Y0.000 measured at X0.003, Y0.004
```
Error = 2 × √(0.003² + 0.004²) = 2 × 0.005 = 0.010"
```

**Bonus Tolerance**: When position tolerance specifies MMC (Ⓜ), additional tolerance is gained as feature departs from MMC

**Benefits**:
- Circular tolerance zone vs. square (57% more area)
- Functional: Reflects mating conditions
- Bonus tolerance increases yield

### Concentricity

**Symbol**: ◎

**Definition**: The median points of diametrically opposed elements of a feature must lie within a cylindrical tolerance zone coaxial with datum axis.

**Tolerance Zone**: Cylinder centered on datum axis

**Example**: `◎ 0.005 A` means median points must lie within Ø0.005" cylinder coaxial with datum A

**Application**: Dynamic balance, rotating assemblies

**Measurement**: Difficult – requires measuring median points, not surface

**Modern Practice**: Often replaced by runout or position at RFS

### Symmetry

**Symbol**: ⌯

**Definition**: The median points of opposed elements of a feature must lie within a tolerance zone centered on datum plane.

**Tolerance Zone**: Two parallel planes symmetrically disposed about datum plane

**Example**: `⌯ 0.008 A` means median points within 0.008" zone centered on datum plane A

**Application**: Symmetric parts, balanced features

**Modern Practice**: Rarely used; often replaced by position

## 21.6.6 Profile Tolerances

Profile tolerances control the form, orientation, and sometimes location of complex surfaces.

### Profile of a Surface

**Symbol**: ⌓

**Definition**: The surface must lie between two boundaries offset equally (unless otherwise specified) from the true profile.

**Tolerance Zone**: 3D zone normal to true profile surface

**Applications**:
- Airfoils and aerodynamic surfaces
- Sculptured surfaces
- Complex contours
- Can control form, orientation, and location simultaneously

**With Datum Reference**: `⌓ 0.010 A B C`
- Controls form, orientation, AND location

**Without Datum Reference**: `⌓ 0.010`
- Controls form only

**Unequally Disposed**: Can specify offset (e.g., +0.008/-0.002)

**Measurement**: CMM with CAD comparison

### Profile of a Line

**Symbol**: ⌒

**Definition**: Each line element on the surface must lie between two boundaries in the plane of the line element.

**Difference from Surface Profile**: Controls line elements independently (no control between lines)

**Application**: Extrusions, constant cross-sections, less restrictive than surface profile

---

## 21.6.7 Runout

Runout controls the combined effects of form and location relative to a datum axis.

### Circular Runout

**Symbol**: ↗

**Definition**: Each circular element must be within tolerance when the part is rotated 360° about a datum axis.

**Tolerance Zone**: Two concentric circles at each measuring position

**Example**: `↗ 0.003 A` means each cross-section must indicate ≤0.003" when rotated about datum A

**Measurement**:
- Mount part on datum axis (between centers, on mandrel, or in collet)
- Rotate part 360°
- Indicator at fixed position records variation
- Repeat at multiple axial positions

**Controls** (at each position independently):
- Circularity
- Coaxiality
- Perpendicularity (for face runout)

### Total Runout

**Symbol**: ↗↗

**Definition**: Entire surface must be within tolerance when part is rotated 360° about datum axis while indicator traverses the surface.

**Tolerance Zone**: Two coaxial cylinders (or two parallel planes for face)

**Example**: `↗↗ 0.005 A` means entire surface must indicate ≤0.005" during full rotation and traverse

**Measurement**:
- Mount part on datum axis
- Rotate part continuously
- Traverse indicator along surface
- Maximum variation = total runout error

**Controls**:
- Circular runout at all positions
- Cylindricity
- Straightness
- Taper
- Coaxiality

**Most Comprehensive**: Total runout is the most restrictive control for rotating parts

## 21.6.8 Material Condition Modifiers

Material condition modifiers adjust tolerance based on feature size.

### Maximum Material Condition (MMC) – Ⓜ

**Definition**: The condition where a feature contains the maximum amount of material within size limits.

**Examples**:
- Shaft: Largest allowable diameter
- Hole: Smallest allowable diameter

**Bonus Tolerance Concept**:

When MMC is specified, additional tolerance is allowed as the feature departs from MMC.

**Example**: Hole Ø0.500 ±0.005, Position Ø0.010 Ⓜ A B C

| Actual Hole Size | Position Tolerance | Total Tolerance |
|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 0.495 (MMC) | 0.010 | 0.010 |
| 0.500 (Nominal) | 0.015 | 0.015 |
| 0.505 (LMC) | 0.020 | 0.020 |

**Bonus** = Actual size - MMC size

**Functional Justification**: Larger hole accepts larger positional error while maintaining assembly

**Benefits**:
- Increased manufacturing tolerance
- Reduced scrap
- Reflects functional requirements

### Least Material Condition (LMC) – Ⓛ

**Definition**: The condition where a feature contains the minimum amount of material within size limits.

**Examples**:
- Shaft: Smallest allowable diameter
- Hole: Largest allowable diameter

**Application**: Controls minimum wall thickness, minimum material in threaded features

**Less Common**: Used primarily when minimum material is critical

### Regardless of Feature Size (RFS)

**Definition**: Geometric tolerance applies at any feature size; no bonus tolerance.

**Default in ASME Y14.5-2009**: If no modifier shown, RFS is implied

**Application**: When function requires consistent geometric tolerance regardless of size
