# Module 21 – Metrology and Precision Measurement


On-machine measurement integrates inspection directly into the machining process, reducing setup time, improving accuracy, and enabling adaptive machining strategies.

## 21.5.1 Touch Probes and Tool Setters

### Touch Probes (Workpiece Probing)

Touch probes mounted in the machine spindle measure part location, features, and dimensions without removing the part.

**Types**:

**Kinematic (Strain Gage) Probes**:
- Most accurate type
- Measure deflection in X, Y, Z directions
- Accuracy: ±1-2 μm
- Typically optical or radio signal transmission
- Examples: Renishaw RMP, Blum TC

**Touch Trigger Probes**:
- Binary contact detection (touch/no touch)
- Simpler and less expensive
- Accuracy: ±2-5 μm
- Examples: Renishaw OMP, Heidenhain TT

**Signal Transmission**:
- **Infrared optical**: Line of sight required, no interference
- **Radio**: 360° coverage, may have interference
- **Hard-wired**: Most reliable but limits motion

### Probe Applications

**Part Setup and Alignment**:

1. **Workpiece Location**: Find edges and corners to establish work coordinate system
2. **Rotation Alignment**: Detect and correct angular misalignment
3. **Feature Location**: Find hole centers, boss locations, slot positions

**In-Process Inspection**:

1. **Dimensional Verification**: Measure critical features before removing part
2. **Tool Wear Compensation**: Detect excessive tool wear and adjust
3. **Multi-Setup Verification**: Verify datum alignment between operations

**Adaptive Machining**:

1. **Stock Measurement**: Measure actual stock condition (casting variation)
2. **Dynamic Offset**: Adjust tool offsets based on measured conditions
3. **Closed-Loop Machining**: Re-measure and re-machine until tolerance achieved

### Probe Calibration

**Probe Qualification**:

Before use, probe must be calibrated to establish:
- Effective tip diameter
- Trigger point in all directions
- Stylus length

**Process**:
1. Mount reference sphere (certified master)
2. Probe sphere from multiple angles (typically 5-25 points)
3. Control calculates effective probe diameter and offsets
4. Store calibration data in machine

**Re-qualification Required**:
- After probe/stylus change
- After probe crash or suspected damage
- Periodically (daily for critical work)
- After machine warmup

### Tool Setters

## 21.5.3 Adaptive Machining with Closed-Loop Feedback

Adaptive machining uses measurement feedback to automatically adjust machining parameters.

### Closed-Loop Machining Process

**Traditional (Open-Loop)**:
1. Program assumes nominal stock and tool conditions
2. Machine executes program
3. Inspect after completion
4. Scrap or rework if out of tolerance

**Adaptive (Closed-Loop)**:
1. Measure actual stock condition
2. Calculate required material removal
3. Machine with adjusted parameters
4. Measure result
5. Repeat until within tolerance

### Applications

Solution:
- Probe casting surfaces before machining

- Adjust toolpaths to accommodate variation
- Optimize material removal

**High-Value Part Finishing**:

Solution:
- Machine conservatively
- Measure in-process
- Take additional finishing passes if needed
- Guarantee first-piece success

**Thin-Wall Machining**:

- Adjust semi-finishing passes based on results
- Final light finishing pass after stress relief

### Implementation Considerations

**Advantages**:
- Reduced scrap on first article
- Accommodates stock variation
- Enables near-net-shape manufacturing
- Improves process capability

**Disadvantages**:
- Longer cycle time (measurement time)
- Complex programming
- Requires skilled setup and maintenance
- Higher equipment cost

## 21.5.4 Tool Wear Monitoring

Tool wear directly affects part quality and dimensional accuracy. Monitoring tool condition prevents scrapped parts.

### Direct Tool Measurement

**Tool Setter Monitoring**:

- Measure tool before and after machining

- Tool diameter: Detects chipping or gradual wear
- Runout: Detects holder problems

### Indirect Tool Monitoring

**Power/Load Monitoring**:

- Monitor spindle load or servo current
- Dull tools require more cutting force
- Set thresholds for tool change
- Can detect tool breakage instantly

**Vibration Monitoring**:

2. Probe X- edge (approach from X+)
3. Calculate X center: (X+ + X-) / 2
4. Repeat for Y axis
5. Set work coordinate system (G54-G59)

**Corner Finding**:

4. Calculate work coordinate system transformation

### Bore and Hole Center Finding

- 3 points minimum, 4-5 typical, 8+ for critical features

### Multi-Face/Multi-Setup Probing

**Tombstone Setup**:

- Probe each part on multi-face fixture
- Establish individual work offsets (G54.1 P1-P99)
- Compensate for fixture tolerance stack-up

**Between-Operation Datum**:

- Probe finished features from prior operation
- Establish datum for current operation
- Ensures feature-to-feature alignment
