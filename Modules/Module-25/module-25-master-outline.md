## Important Note

This module addresses work-life balance broadly, but individual circumstances vary greatly. The strategies presented should be adapted to personal situations, family dynamics, health conditions, and workplace realities. When facing serious health issues (physical or mental), always consult qualified healthcare professionals.

Work-life balance is a journey, not a destination. It requires continuous attention, adjustment, and commitment. The goal is sustainable wellbeing over a long career, not perfection at any given moment.
