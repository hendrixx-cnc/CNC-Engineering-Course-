# 17.7 Surface Finishing Techniques for Advanced Materials

## Why Surface Finish Matters for Advanced Materials

### Mechanical Performance

**Strength Dependency on Surface Quality**:

Ceramics and composites are extremely sensitive to surface defects:

$$\sigma_{fracture} = \frac{K_{IC}}{\sqrt{\pi \times a}}$$

where:
- $\sigma_{fracture}$ = fracture strength
- $K_{IC}$ = fracture toughness (material property)
- $a$ = crack/defect size

**Example** (alumina ceramic):
- Material: 99% alumina, $K_{IC}$ = 4 MPa√m
- As-ground surface: $a$ = 50 μm surface cracks
  - Strength: 4 / √(π × 0.00005) = **320 MPa**
- Polished surface: $a$ = 5 μm
  - Strength: 4 / √(π × 0.000005) = **1,010 MPa**

**3× strength improvement from polishing!**

**Composites**:
- Rough surfaces = exposed fibers = moisture ingress
- Delamination starts at rough edges
- Surface finish affects fatigue life significantly

### Functional Requirements

**Sealing Surfaces**:
- O-ring grooves in ceramics: Ra <32 μin required
- Rough surface = leak paths

**Optical Applications**:
- Ceramic windows: Ra <5 μin for optical clarity
- Polishing removes subsurface damage (scattering sites)

**Aesthetic Applications**:
- Carbon fiber parts: High-gloss finish expected
- Surface finish = quality perception

**Biomedical**:
- Implants: Ra <10 μin reduces bacterial adhesion
- Smooth surface = better tissue integration

## Composite Surface Finishing

### Post-Machining Defects

**Fuzzing**: Loose fibers standing up from surface
- Cause: Dull tools, improper feed direction
- Appearance: Hairy, uneven

**Delamination**: Plies separating at edges
- Cause: Exit tear-out, improper support
- Visible as gaps between layers

**Fiber Pullout**: Holes where fibers torn out
- Cause: Cutting against fiber direction, dull tools
- Affects surface appearance and strength

**Resin Smearing**: Melted resin covering fibers
- Cause: Excessive heat (dull tool, high speed)
- Appearance: Glossy, gummy surface

### Abrasive Finishing Methods

**Sanding**:

**Grit Progression**:
1. **80-120 grit**: Remove machining marks, level surface
2. **180-220 grit**: Smooth surface, remove 80-120 scratches
3. **320-400 grit**: Pre-finishing
4. **600-800 grit**: Final dry sanding

**Sanding Technique**:
- Always sand in direction of fibers (if unidirectional weave)
- Light pressure (heavy = heat = resin smearing)
- Dust extraction mandatory (carbon fiber dust hazardous)

**Hand Sanding vs Machine**:
- Hand: Better control, less heat, slower
- Random-orbital sander: Faster, consistent, heat risk with prolonged contact
- Avoid belt sanders (too aggressive, heat buildup)

**Wet Sanding** (600+ grit):
- Water lubricates, cools, captures dust
- Achieves smoother finish (grit cuts cooler)
- Final step before polishing

**Sanding Block**: Use firm backing
- Prevents sander following contours of defects
- Maintains flatness

**Example Sanding Schedule**:
- As-machined CFRP: Ra 200 μin, visible machining marks
- 120 grit, 5 min → Ra 100 μin
- 220 grit, 5 min → Ra 50 μin
- 400 grit, 5 min → Ra 25 μin
- 800 grit wet, 10 min → Ra 15 μin

**Abrasive Pads** (Scotch-Brite type):
- Coarse (maroon): Equivalent to 120-150 grit
- Medium (gray): 220-320 grit
- Fine (white): 600-800 grit
- Conformable (good for curved surfaces)
- Less aggressive than sandpaper (good for light cleanup)

### Trimming and Edge Finishing

**Router Trimming**:
- Clean up rough-cut edges
- Diamond-coated or carbide compression bits
- Light passes (0.020-0.050" per pass)
- Prevents delamination at exit

**File Finishing**:
- Fine-cut mill bastard file
- Remove burrs, smooth edges
- Cut on push stroke only (don't drag back)

**Edge Sanding**:
- Sandpaper on hard block
- Slightly bevel sharp edges (0.005-0.010" radius)
- Prevents ply lifting at edges

### Polishing Composites

**Polishing Compounds**:

**Rubbing Compound** (coarse polish):
- Abrasive: Aluminum oxide, ~3000 grit equivalent
- Removes fine scratches from 800-grit sanding
- Apply by hand (soft cloth) or machine (foam pad)

**Polishing Compound** (fine polish):
- Abrasive: Finer particles, ~6000 grit equivalent
- Brings out gloss
- Multiple applications improve finish

**Example**:
- 3M Perfect-It Rubbing Compound → Polishing Compound
- Each step: Apply, rub/buff, wipe clean, inspect

**Machine Polishing**:
- Rotary buffer: 1500-2500 RPM with foam pad
- Light pressure (let abrasive do work, not pressure)
- Keep moving (avoid heat buildup in one spot)
- Heat = resin softening = smearing

**Result**: High-gloss finish, Ra 5-10 μin achievable

### Clear Coating

**Purpose**:
- Protect surface from UV (resin degrades in sunlight)
- Fill minor imperfections
- Enhance gloss
- Seal against moisture

**Types**:

**Epoxy Clear Coat**:
- Thick build (10-20 mils)
- Excellent UV protection
- Hard, durable
- Requires mixing (2-part)
- Application: Brush, roller, or pour-on

**Polyurethane**:
- Good UV resistance
- Flexible (less brittle than epoxy)
- 1-part or 2-part
- Application: Spray or brush

**Automotive Clear Coat** (2K urethane):
- Professional-grade finish
- Excellent gloss and durability
- Requires spray gun
- Expensive equipment

**Application Process**:
1. **Surface prep**: 400-600 grit wet sand
2. **Clean**: Isopropyl alcohol, lint-free cloth
3. **First coat**: Thin, seal surface
4. **Additional coats**: 2-5 coats (per product instructions)
5. **Cure**: Full cure 24-72 hours (temperature-dependent)
6. **Wet sand**: 1000-2000 grit (if imperfections)
7. **Final polish**: Rubbing compound → polishing compound

**Result**: Mirror-like finish, protected surface

### Filled Edge Finishing

**Problem**: Carbon fiber weave creates voids at cut edges
- Hollow appearance
- Not sealed against moisture

**Solution**: Fill voids before finishing

**Filler Options**:
- **Epoxy resin**: Thin enough to penetrate voids, strong
- **CA glue (cyanoacrylate)**: Fast cure, hard, easy to sand
- **Body filler**: Fast, easy to shape, less strong

**Process**:
1. Apply filler to edge (brush or scrape)
2. Allow to cure
3. Sand flush with surface (80-120 grit)
4. Refill low spots (may require 2-3 applications)
5. Final sand smooth (220-400 grit)
6. Proceed with normal finishing (sanding, polishing)

**Result**: Solid-looking edge, sealed against moisture

## Ceramic Surface Finishing

### Post-Grinding Finish Improvement

**As-Ground Surface**:
- Diamond grinding: Ra 20-100 μin typical
- Visible grinding marks
- Subsurface damage: 5-50 μm deep (microcracks)

**Improving Finish**:

**Fine Grinding**:
- Switch to finer grit wheel (600-1200 grit)
- Very light depth of cut (0.0001-0.0002" per pass)
- Lower table speed (longer dwell time)
- Achieves Ra 10-20 μin

**Honing**:
- Bonded abrasive stones (similar to grinding, finer grit)
- Reciprocating motion
- Good for cylindrical surfaces (bearing bores)
- Achieves Ra 5-15 μin

### Lapping Ceramics

**Process**: Loose abrasive slurry on lap plate

**Equipment**:
- Lap plate: Cast iron or glass (flat reference surface)
- Abrasive: Diamond paste or suspension
- Pressure: Part pressed onto lap (by hand or weighted)

**Grit Progression**:
1. **30 μm diamond**: Remove grinding damage, flatten
   - Removal rate: 0.001-0.002"/10 min
   - Finish: Ra 40 μin
2. **15 μm diamond**: Remove 30 μm scratches
   - Removal rate: 0.0005"/10 min
   - Finish: Ra 20 μin
3. **9 μm diamond**: Pre-polish
   - Removal rate: 0.0002"/10 min
   - Finish: Ra 10 μin
4. **3 μm diamond**: Final lap
   - Removal rate: 0.0001"/10 min
   - Finish: Ra 5 μin

**Technique**:
- Figure-8 motion (distributes wear evenly on lap)
- Rotate part periodically (prevents part cupping)
- Wet surface (slurry must stay liquid)
- Clean between grits (contamination ruins finer steps)

**Lap Maintenance**:
- Lap wears (becomes concave in center)
- Re-flatten with coarser grit or use three-plate method
- Three-plate: Lap plates lap each other flat

**Applications**:
- Gage blocks, precision spacers
- Seal faces (mechanical seals)
- Optical flats (when followed by polishing)

### Polishing Ceramics

**Objective**: Mirror finish, minimal subsurface damage

**Polishing vs Lapping**:
- Lapping: Bonded or loose abrasive, removes measurable stock
- Polishing: Very fine abrasive, removes scratches only

**Polishing Cloth**:
- Soft pad (neoprene, felt, polyurethane foam)
- Conforms to surface
- Less aggressive than hard lap

**Abrasives**:
- **3 μm diamond paste**: Pre-polish
- **1 μm diamond paste**: Polish
- **0.25 μm diamond paste**: Fine polish
- **0.05 μm colloidal silica**: Final polish (chemical-mechanical)

**Colloidal Silica**:
- Suspension of ultra-fine silica particles
- Mild chemical action (dissolves strained surface layer)
- Mechanical action (abrasion)
- Removes subsurface damage without creating new damage
- Achieves Ra <5 μin (mirror finish)

**Example Polishing Schedule** (alumina):
1. **9 μm diamond on hard pad**, 5 min → Ra 15 μin
2. **3 μm diamond on medium pad**, 5 min → Ra 8 μin
3. **1 μm diamond on soft pad**, 10 min → Ra 4 μin
4. **0.05 μm colloidal silica**, 15 min → Ra 2 μin, mirror finish

**Machine Polishing**:
- Vibratory polisher: Part and abrasive vibrate together (batch process)
- Rotary polisher: Part rotates against polishing pad
- Automatic (less labor, consistent results)

**Hand Polishing**:
- More control
- Small parts or low volume
- Tedious for large areas

**Cleaning Between Steps**:
- Ultrasonic cleaner (water + detergent)
- Removes previous grit (prevents contamination)
- Dry thoroughly before next step

### Thermal Treatments for Surface Improvement

**Annealing** (stress relief):

**Purpose**: Remove residual tensile stress from grinding
- Tensile stress reduces strength (cracks open easier)
- Annealing relaxes stress

**Process**:
- Heat to 50-70% of sintering temperature
- Hold 1-4 hours
- Slow cool (prevent thermal shock)

**Example** (99% alumina):
- Sintering temp: 1600-1700°C
- Annealing temp: 1000-1200°C
- Hold: 2 hours
- Cool rate: 100°C/hour (slow)

**Result**: 10-30% strength increase

**Glazing** (surface melting):

**Purpose**: Melt thin surface layer → smooth, sealed surface

**Process**:
- Rapid heating of surface only (laser, flame)
- Surface melts, flows, re-solidifies
- Removes surface roughness

**Challenges**:
- Thermal shock (can crack part)
- Microstructure change (melted layer different properties)
- Difficult to control

**Limited Use**: Research, specialized applications

## Edge Quality and Deburring

### Composite Edge Deburring

**Fuzzing Removal**:
- Light sanding (220-320 grit)
- Abrasive pad (fine)
- Rub edge gently (don't round over excessively)

**Delaminated Edge Repair**:
1. Clean gap (compressed air)
2. Inject thin epoxy or CA glue
3. Clamp plies together (C-clamp with soft jaws)
4. Cure, sand flush

**Sharp Edge Treatment**:
- Slight radius (0.010-0.020") prevents ply lifting
- Sandpaper on hard block
- 45° chamfer or radius

### Ceramic Edge Deburring

**Edge Chipping** (common defect):
- Grinding creates tiny chips at edges
- Weakens edge, stress concentration

**Diamond Honing**:
- Fine diamond stone (600-1200 grit)
- Lightly chamfer edge (0.002-0.005")
- Removes fragile edge chips

**Vibratory Deburring**:
- Parts + ceramic media + compound in vibrating tub
- Tumbles parts, rounds edges
- Hours to days (slow)
- Good for batch processing

**Hand Deburring**:
- Diamond file or stone
- Careful chamfering by hand
- Small parts, low volume

## Surface Finish Measurement

### Contact Methods

**Profilometer** (stylus type):
- Stylus drags across surface
- Measures vertical displacement (surface profile)
- Output: Ra, Rz, profile graph

**Advantages**:
- Quantitative (Ra value)
- Industry standard

**Disadvantages**:
- Slow (point-by-point measurement)
- Stylus can damage soft materials
- Expensive ($5,000-50,000)

**Ra Definition**: Average roughness
$$Ra = \frac{1}{L} \int_0^L |y(x)| dx$$

where $y(x)$ = height deviation from mean line

**Interpretation**:
- Ra 125 μin: Rough (as-ground with coarse wheel)
- Ra 63 μin: Medium (standard machined surface)
- Ra 32 μin: Smooth (ground with fine wheel)
- Ra 16 μin: Fine (polished)
- Ra 4 μin: Very fine (mirror finish)

### Non-Contact Methods

**Optical Profilometer**:
- Light interference measures surface height
- Very fine resolution (<1 nm vertical)
- No contact (doesn't damage surface)
- 3D surface map
- Expensive ($50,000-200,000)

**Visual Inspection**:
- Comparator blocks (surface roughness standards)
- Match part to standard block by feel/appearance
- Inexpensive, subjective

### Gloss Measurement

**Glossmeter**:
- Measures specular reflection (shininess)
- Units: Gloss units (GU)
- 60° angle standard

**Interpretation**:
- <10 GU: Matte
- 10-70 GU: Semi-gloss
- >70 GU: High gloss
- >90 GU: Mirror-like

**Use for Composites**:
- Verifies polishing quality
- Consistent finish batch-to-batch
- Cost: $500-3,000
