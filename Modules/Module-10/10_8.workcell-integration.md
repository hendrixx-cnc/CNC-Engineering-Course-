# Module 10 – Robotic Arm


Integrating robotic arms with CNC machines and other equipment creates flexible manufacturing cells. This section covers communication protocols, coordination strategies, and complete workcell design.

## Integration Architectures

### Standalone Robot + CNC

**Independent Controllers**

Configuration:

- Handshaking signals (simple I/O)
- Serial communication (RS-232)
- Industrial Ethernet (Modbus TCP, EtherCAT)

Advantages:
- Maximum flexibility
- Standard equipment (no custom integration)
- Easily expandable

Disadvantages:

## Communication Protocols

### Digital I/O (Hardwired)

**Signal Types**

CNC Outputs → Robot Inputs:
- Cycle complete (CNC finished machining)
- Door open (safe for robot entry)
- Part present (part in fixture)
- Ready for load/unload
- Error/fault

Robot Outputs → CNC Inputs:
- Part loaded (robot placed workpiece)
- Part unloaded (robot removed part)
- Robot busy (do not close door)
- Load/unload complete
- Robot error/fault

**Electrical Interface**

Voltage Levels:
- 24V DC (most common industrial standard)
- Sinking vs. sourcing I/O
- Verify compatibility between devices

Wiring:
- Shielded cable for noise immunity
- Separate from power cables
- Terminal blocks for connections
- Fused or protected circuits

**Handshaking Sequence Example**

Machine Tending:
1. CNC completes part, signals "Cycle Complete"
2. CNC opens door, signals "Door Open"
3. Robot detects signals, signals "Robot Busy"
4. Robot enters work area, unloads finished part
5. Robot loads new workpiece
6. Robot exits, signals "Part Loaded" and clears "Robot Busy"
7. CNC closes door
8. CNC starts machining cycle

Timing:
- Typical: 5-20 second robot cycle
- CNC may take 2-10 minutes
- Robot waits for CNC completion

**Advantages**
- Simple, reliable
- No special protocols
- Easy troubleshooting (multimeter)

**Disadvantages**
- Limited data (only on/off signals)
- Many wires for complex cells
- No feedback beyond binary states

### Serial Communication

**RS-232**

Characteristics:
- Point-to-point (one-to-one)
- Distance: Up to 15 meters
- Speed: 9600 to 115200 baud typical
- Simple protocol

Message Format (Example):
```
Robot → CNC: "READY\r\n"
CNC → Robot: "LOAD_PART\r\n"
Robot → CNC: "LOADING\r\n"
Robot → CNC: "LOAD_COMPLETE\r\n"
CNC → Robot: "START_CYCLE\r\n"
```

Applications:
- Send part numbers or programs
- Request status information
- Transmit measurement data

**RS-485**

Characteristics:
- Multi-drop (one-to-many)
- Distance: Up to 1200 meters
- Higher noise immunity than RS-232
- Requires termination resistors

Use:
- Multiple devices on one bus
- Fieldbus protocols (Modbus RTU)

### Industrial Ethernet

**Modbus TCP**

Implementation:
```python
from pymodbus.client import ModbusTcpClient

client = ModbusTcpClient('192.168.1.100')
client.write_coil(0, True)  # Signal start
status = client.read_coils(10, 1)  # Read complete flag
client.close()
```

Data Types:
- Coils: Binary outputs (write)

**PROFINET**

Industrial Ethernet:

- Standard Ethernet hardware with PROFINET stack
- Common in Siemens PLCs

**Ethernet/IP**

CIP Protocol:
- Used by Allen-Bradley/Rockwell
- Standard Ethernet
- Moderate performance (not hard real-time)

**OPC UA**

Modern Standard:
- Platform-independent
- Secure (encryption, authentication)
- Supports complex data structures
- Growing adoption in Industry 4.0

Example:
```python
from opcua import Client

client = Client("opc.tcp://192.168.1.100:4840")
client.connect()
node = client.get_node("ns=2;i=10")  # Part count
value = node.get_value()
client.disconnect()
```

## CNC Machine Tending

### Door Control

5. Wait for clamp confirmation
6. Open gripper
7. Retract

**Part Flipping**

Multi-Operation Machining:
