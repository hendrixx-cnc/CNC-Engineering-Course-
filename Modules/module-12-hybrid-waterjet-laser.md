# Module 12 – Hybrid Water-Jet Guided Laser Systems

## 1. Introduction

Hybrid water-jet guided laser systems combine the cutting power of a fiber laser with the edge quality and cooling of a water-jet. The laser beam is focused into a high-pressure water jet, which guides and cools the beam as it cuts.

## 2. Principles

- Fiber laser source delivers the beam to a nozzle.
- High-pressure water jet acts as an optical waveguide for the laser.
- Water cools the cut zone and carries away debris.

## 3. Advantages

- Minimal heat-affected zone (HAZ), suitable for sensitive materials.
- High-precision, burr-free edges even in metals and composites.
- Reduced thermal stress, lower risk of microcracks.

## 4. Key Components

- Fiber laser source (1–4 kW typical).
- High-pressure pump (3000–6000 bar).
- Hybrid nozzle with sapphire orifice and focusing optics.
- CNC gantry and enclosure for safety and fume extraction.

## 5. Control & Automation

- Dual feedback for laser and water flow.
- Synchronized motion for nozzle, pump, and laser firing.
- Automated abrasive feed (optional for hard materials).

## 6. Safety

- Interlocked enclosure with water-resistant seals.
- Fume extraction and splash shielding.
- Emergency stop circuits for both laser and pump.

## 7. Maintenance

- Regular nozzle cleaning and replacement.
- Water filtration and pump service.
- Laser optics inspection.

## 8. Applications

- Cutting glass, ceramics, metals, and composites.
- Micro-machining, biomedical, and electronics industries.

## 9. Conclusion

Hybrid water-jet guided lasers offer unmatched precision and material versatility, ideal for advanced manufacturing and research.
