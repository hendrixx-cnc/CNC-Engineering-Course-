# Module 24 – L.E.A.N. Strategies for CNC Manufacturing


## 24.18.1 Unique Challenges of Job Shop L.E.A.N.

**CNC Job Shops** face unique challenges when implementing Lean due to high-mix, low-volume production.

### 24.18.1.1 High Mix, Low Volume

**Characteristics:**
- Many different part numbers (100s to 1000s)
- Small quantities per part (1-100 pieces)
- Custom or semi-custom products
- Frequent changeovers

**Lean Challenges:**

**Challenge 1: Can't Dedicate Equipment**
- Traditional Lean: Dedicated cells for product families
- Job Shop Reality: Same machine serves many products
- **Implication:** Cells must be flexible, equipment shared

**Challenge 2: Difficult to Balance**
- Traditional Lean: Balance to takt time
- Job Shop Reality: Takt time varies by product
- **Implication:** Flexible staffing, focus on cycle time reduction

**Challenge 3: Large Batch Temptation**
- Setup time amortized over larger batches
- Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) drives large batches
- **Implication:** Setup reduction (SMED) is CRITICAL

**Challenge 4: Complex Scheduling**
- Many products competing for same resources
- Difficult to level-load
- **Implication:** Visual scheduling, pull where possible

### 24.18.1.2 Variable Demand

**Characteristics:**
- Customer orders unpredictable
- Demand varies week-to-week
- Rush orders common
- Product mix changes

**Lean Challenges:**

**Challenge: Heijunka Difficult**
- Traditional Lean: Level production schedule
- Job Shop Reality: Demand lumpy, unpredictable
- **Implication:** Build flexibility, quick response capability

**Challenge: Inventory Sizing**
- Traditional Lean: Calculate Kanban based on stable demand
- Job Shop Reality: Demand unstable
- **Implication:** Larger safety stocks, or make-to-order

**Challenge: Capacity Planning**
- Variable demand = variable capacity needs
- Overtime or idle time
- **Implication:** Flexible workforce, cross-training

### 24.18.1.3 Custom Products

**Characteristics:**
- Engineered-to-order or custom modifications
- First-time production common
- Process development on the fly

**Lean Challenges:**

**Challenge: No Standard Work (Yet)**
- First-time production = no prior experience
- Learning curve
- **Implication:** Rapid standardization after first run

**Challenge: Tooling/Fixtures Custom**
- Can't use standard fixtures
- Custom tooling for each product
- **Implication:** Modular fixturing, quick-change systems

**Challenge: Programming Time**
- New programs for each product
- CAM programming time significant
- **Implication:** Offline programming, standardized templates

**Quote from Art Byrne (Wiremold CEO):**
*"Job shops can't do Lean" is the biggest myth. Job shops NEED Lean more than anyone—they can't afford the waste."*

## 24.18.2 Adapted Lean Tools for Job Shops

### 24.18.2.1 Flexible Work Cells

**Traditional Cellular Manufacturing:**
- Dedicated equipment for product family
- High-volume, limited variety
- Example: Shaft family cell (lathes, grinders)

**Job Shop Cellular Approach:**

**1. Product Family Cells (Where Possible):**
- Group by similar process routing
- NOT dedicated equipment, but preferred routing
- Example: "Small Aluminum Parts" cell (common routing)

**2. Flexible Cells:**
- Cell can produce multiple families
- Quick changeover critical
- Modular fixturing
- Example: "Prismatic Parts" cell (any rectangular part)

**3. Shared Resources:**
- Some operations shared (heat treat, painting, CMM)
- Supermarkets before/after shared operations
- Pull replenishment

**4. Multi-Machine Operators:**
- Operator tends multiple machines in cell
- Flexible based on demand (1-3 operators)
- Cross-trained

**Example: Job Shop Cell**

**Before (Functional Layout):**
```
Mill Dept → Drill Dept → Tap Dept → Deburr Dept
(Travel across shop, batching required)
Lead time: 10-15 days
```

**After (Flexible Cell):**
```
Cell 1 (Small Parts):
Mill → Drill → Tap → Deburr (all within 20 feet)

Handles 50+ part numbers (aluminum, small)
Changeover: 10 minutes (SMED)
Lead time: 1-2 days
```

**Keys to Success:**
- SMED (quick changeovers enable small batches)
- Modular fixturing (fast changeover)
- Cross-training (operators can run any operation)
- Visual scheduling (prioritize work)

### 24.18.2.2 Quick Changeover Emphasis

**SMED is THE most important Lean tool for job shops.**

**Why:**
- High mix = many changeovers
- Long setups force large batches (anti-Lean)
- Short setups enable one-piece flow (even in job shop)

**Job Shop SMED Targets:**
- < 10 minutes for simple products (standard fixtures)
- < 30 minutes for complex products (custom fixtures)
- **Goal: Single-digit changeovers wherever possible**

**Techniques:**

**1. Quick-Change Fixture Systems:**
- Master plates on machines (permanent)
- Subplates with fixtures (quick-change)
- Standardized clamping
- Example: Erowa, System 3R, 5th Axis

**2. Tool Presetting:**
- Offline tool presetter machine
- Pre-set all tools before changeover
- Load into machine with offsets
- No touch-off time

**3. Program Management:**
- Programs stored on network/USB
- Quick load (seconds)
- Standardized structure
- Proven programs (don't change)

**4. Kitting:**
- All tools, fixtures, programs in one kit
- Kit staged before changeover
- No searching

**5. Standard Work for Changeovers:**
- Document best method
- Train all operators
- Continuous improvement

**Example:**

**Before SMED:**
- Setup time: 90 minutes avg
- Economic batch: 100 pieces (to justify setup)
- Changeovers: 2 per week (avoid if possible)
- Lead time: 12 days (large batch WIP)

**After SMED:**
- Setup time: 12 minutes avg (87% reduction!)
- Economic batch: 10 pieces (setup time negligible)
- Changeovers: 10+ per week (no problem)
- Lead time: 2 days (small batch flow)

**Impact:**
- Inventory reduced 80%
- Lead time reduced 83%
- Flexibility increased dramatically

### 24.18.2.3 Cross-Training

**Job shops MUST have flexible workforce.**

**Why:**
- Demand varies (need to shift capacity)
- Bottlenecks change (based on product mix)
- Absences/vacations (can't shut down)

**Cross-Training Strategy:**

**Skill Matrix:**
```
┌─────────────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┐
│  Operator   │ Mill │Lathe │Drill │ Grind│ Insp │
├─────────────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┤
│ Maria G.    │  ●   │  ◐   │  ●   │  ○   │  ●   │
├─────────────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┤
│ Tom R.      │  ●   │  ●   │  ◐   │  ●   │  ◐   │
├─────────────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┤
│ Sarah K.    │  ◐   │  ●   │  ●   │  ●   │  ●   │
├─────────────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┤
│ John S.     │  ●   │  ○   │  ●   │  ◐   │  ○   │
└─────────────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┘

● = Proficient (can train others)
◐ = Competent (can do independently)
○ = Learning (needs supervision)
```

**Goal:** Everyone proficient in 2+ operations

**Training Plan:**
- Identify gaps (○ → ◐ → ●)
- Pair learner with proficient operator
- Use standardized work for training
- Certify competency

**Benefits:**
- Shift operators to bottlenecks
- Cover absences
- Increase flexibility
- Employee engagement (variety)

**Staffing Flexibility:**

**Low Demand Day:**
- 3 operators, each running 2-3 machines
- Multi-process handling

**High Demand Day:**
- 6 operators, dedicated to machines
- Faster throughput

**Cross-training enables this flexibility!**

## 24.18.3 Family-Based Value Streams

**Value Stream Mapping (VSM) for job shops uses product families.**

### Defining Product Families

**Can't map every product** (100s of SKUs).

**Group by Similarity:**

**Option 1: Process Routing**
- Similar sequence of operations
- Example: All parts requiring Mill → Drill → Tap

**Option 2: Material**
- Aluminum family, Steel family, Plastic family
- Similar machining characteristics

**Option 3: Size**
- Small parts (<6" cube), Medium, Large
- Similar machines and fixturing

**Option 4: Customer/Market**
- Aerospace family (tight tolerances, certs)
- Commercial family (standard tolerances)

**Criteria:**
- 70-80% of parts in family follow same routing
- Variations manageable
- Sufficient volume (to justify effort)

### Family VSM Example

**Product Family: Small Aluminum Parts**
- 45 part numbers
- 60% of job shop volume
- Common routing: Mill roughing → Mill finishing → Deburr → Inspect

**Current State VSM:**
```
Supplier → [Raw Mat] → [Mill Rough] → [WIP: 5 days] → 
[Mill Finish] → [WIP: 3 days] → [Deburr] → [WIP: 1 day] → 
[Inspect] → [WIP: 1 day] → Customer

Lead Time: 10 days
Value-Added Time: 2 hours
VA Ratio: 0.8%
```

**Future State VSM:**
```
Supplier → [Supermarket] → [CELL: Mill R → Mill F → Deburr → Insp] → Customer

Cell with one-piece flow
Lead Time: 1 day
Value-Added Time: 2 hours  
VA Ratio: 10%
```

**Improvement:**
- 90% lead time reduction
- 12.5× VA ratio improvement
- WIP reduced 80%

### Mixed Families

**Reality:** Not all parts fit neatly in families.

**Strategies:**

**80/20 Rule:**
- 20% of products = 80% of volume
- Focus on high runners (create families/cells)
- Low runners in functional area (OK for now)
- Continuous improvement: gradually absorb more into cells

**"Oddball" Products:**
- Custom or one-off products
- Can't justify dedicated cell
- Process in functional area OR
- Route through flexible cell (if similar)

**Hybrid Layout:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SHOP LAYOUT                            │
│                                         │
│  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐            │
│  │  Cell 1  │  │  Cell 2  │            │
│  │ (Alu SM) │  │(Stl SM)  │            │
│  └──────────┘  └──────────┘            │
│                                         │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────┐       │
│  │ Functional Area             │       │
│  │ (Large parts, custom, low   │       │
│  │  volume - gradually shrinks)│       │
│  └─────────────────────────────┘       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 24.18.4 Load Leveling Strategies

**Heijunka (leveling) is difficult in job shops, but some leveling possible.**

### Strategies

**1. Order Management:**
- Negotiate with customers for level orders
- Discounts for predictable schedule
- Minimum order quantities
- Scheduled delivery windows

**2. Backlog Management:**
- Maintain 2-4 week backlog (buffer)
- Smooth production (don't chase every order)
- Sequence work for efficiency

**3. Mix Leveling:**
- Don't batch all Product A, then all Product B
- Mix products daily (if possible)
- Reduces inventory spikes

**Example:**

**Before Leveling:**
- Week 1: 500 Product A (one big order)
- Week 2: 300 Product B
- Week 3: 200 Product C
- Result: Overtime Week 1, idle Week 3

**After Leveling:**
- Week 1: 330 A + 100 B
- Week 2: 170 A + 200 B + 100 C
- Week 3: 100 C
- Result: Smoother workload

**4. Strategic Inventory:**
- For stable products, build small supermarket
- Make-to-stock for common items
- Make-to-order for custom items
- Hybrid approach

**5. Flexible Capacity:**
- Overtime when needed (peaks)
- Cross-training enables shifting
- Temporary help for surges
- Accept that some variation is OK

## 24.18.5 Managing Variability

**Job shops have variability—Lean helps manage it, not eliminate it.**

### Sources of Variability

**Demand Variability:**
- Customer orders fluctuate
- Mix changes
- Rush orders

**Process Variability:**
- Different products = different processes
- Learning curve on new products
- Quality issues

**Supply Variability:**
- Material delivery delays
- Quality issues from suppliers

### Lean Approaches

**1. Reduce Variability Where Possible:**

**Demand:**
- Better forecasting
- Communication with customers
- Pricing to influence demand (off-peak discounts)

**Process:**
- Standardized work (for each product)
- Poka-yoke (error-proof)
- TPM (reduce breakdowns)

**Supply:**
- Supplier partnerships
- Kanban with suppliers
- Quality agreements

**2. Build Flexibility to Handle Variability:**

**Capacity Flexibility:**
- Cross-training
- Overtime capability
- Temp labor

**Equipment Flexibility:**
- Quick changeover (SMED)
- Multi-purpose machines

**Inventory Buffers (Strategic):**
- Finished goods supermarket (stable products)
- Raw material buffers (long lead-time items)
- **Small, calculated buffers (not excess)**

**3. Visual Management of Variability:**

**Visual Scheduling:**
- Backlog board (what's coming)
- Capacity board (where we are)
- Bottleneck tracking

**Andon for Variability:**
- Rush order = red flag (visual)
- All hands to rush order (clear priority)

**4. Continuous Improvement:**
- Each variability spike is Kaizen opportunity
- Why did it happen?
- How to prevent or mitigate?
- Improve the system

## Summary

CNC job shops face unique Lean challenges due to high-mix, low-volume production, variable demand, and custom products. However, job shops NEED Lean more than high-volume manufacturers because they can't afford waste. Adapted Lean tools include flexible work cells, emphasis on quick changeover (SMED), and extensive cross-training for workforce flexibility.

Product family-based value stream mapping groups similar parts for focused improvement. Load leveling strategies include order management, backlog smoothing, and strategic inventory buffers. Managing variability requires both reducing variation where possible and building flexibility to handle remaining variation.

Success stories demonstrate dramatic results: 60-80% lead time reduction, 75%+ inventory reduction, and significant quality improvements. Keys to success include owner/leadership commitment, SMED implementation, operator involvement, and visual management. Job shops that embrace Lean gain competitive advantage through faster response, lower costs, and higher quality.
