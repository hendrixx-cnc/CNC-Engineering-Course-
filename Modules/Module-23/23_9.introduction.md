# Module 23 – Shop Organization and Management


## Introduction

**Visual Management** makes information obvious at a glance—no need to ask, search, or interpret.

**The Problem with Invisible Information:**

Traditional shops hide critical information:
- Status buried in computer systems
- Problems known only to individuals
- Standards documented but not visible
- Priorities unclear

**Result**: Confusion, delays, errors, and wasted time.

**Visual Management Principle:**

**"Information should be self-explanatory and immediately obvious to anyone."**

**Benefits:**
- **Faster understanding**: See status instantly
- **Reduced questions**: Information is obvious
- **Problem visibility**: Issues can't hide
- **Standardization**: Right way is clear
- **Engagement**: Everyone sees and understands goals
- **Accountability**: Performance is public

**This section covers:**
- Principles of visual management
- Visual controls on the shop floor
- Performance boards and metrics displays
- Standard work displays
- Visual inspection aids
- Continuous improvement boards

## 23.9.1 Principles of Visual Management

### 23.9.1.1 See at a Glance

**Information should be visible from a distance.**

**Examples:**

**Poor**: Machine status written on paper at control (must walk over and read)

**Good**: Green/yellow/red light visible across shop
- Green = Running normally
- Yellow = Attention needed (tool life, material low)
- Red = Down (breakdown, setup, no work)

**Poor**: Production schedule in Excel on manager's computer

**Good**: Magnetic scheduling board on wall—everyone sees the plan

**Key Design Elements:**

1. **Size**: Large enough to read from normal viewing distance
   - Floor markings: 4-6 inches wide (visible walking)
   - Signs: 3-6 inch letters (visible 20+ feet away)
   - Boards: Large format (36" × 48" or bigger)

2. **Location**: Where people naturally look
   - Eye level (48-60 inches)
   - Main pathways, not hidden corners
   - Near relevant work area

3. **Simplicity**: Minimal clutter
   - One message per sign
   - Clean, uncluttered boards
   - Remove obsolete information

### 23.9.1.2 Self-Explaining

**Visual controls should require no training to understand.**

**Universal Symbols:**
- **Red**: Stop, danger, problem, nonconforming
- **Yellow**: Caution, attention needed, in-process
- **Green**: Go, good, conforming, on-track
- **Blue**: Information, mandatory action
- **White**: General, neutral

**Pictograms**: Images instead of words
- International (language-independent)
- Quick recognition

**Examples:**

**Good**: Shadow board with tool outlines → obvious where each tool goes

**Good**: Floor marking with footprints → shows where to stand

**Good**: Color-coded bins → Red bin for scrap, green for good parts (no labels needed)

**Poor**: Coded system requiring lookup table → "Zone 3B refers to..."

### 23.9.1.3 Self-Regulating

**Visual system should make abnormal conditions obvious, prompting corrective action.**

**Examples:**

**Andon System** (Manufacturing alert):
- Green light = Normal operation
- Yellow light = Assistance needed (operator pulls cord)
- Red light = Line stopped, immediate response

**Problem Board**:
- Red tags for issues
- Visible accumulation shows unresolved problems
- Drives urgency to resolve

**Min/Max Lines on Bins**:
- Visual trigger when inventory low
- Self-regulating replenishment

**Goal**: Problems can't hide—they're visible and demand action.

## 23.9.2 Visual Controls in the Shop

### 23.9.2.1 Floor Marking and Tape

**Floor marking** organizes and directs traffic and work areas.

**Types and Meanings:**

| Color | Purpose | Examples |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Yellow** | Aisles, traffic lanes | Forklift paths, walkways |
| **White** | Work areas, storage locations | Machine boundary, pallet location |
| **Red** | Danger, defect zones | Fire equipment area, nonconforming material |
| **Green** | Finished goods, safe zones | Completed parts staging |
| **Blue** | Raw material, work in progress | Material storage |
| **Black/Yellow Stripe** | Hazard warning | Loading dock edge, low clearance |
| **Red/White Stripe** | Temporary hazard | Wet floor, temporary obstacle |

**Applications:**

**1. Aisle Marking**

- Yellow lines define traffic lanes
- Width: 3-6 inches
- Straight lines (use chalk line or laser)
- Corners marked (prevent cutting corners)
- Intersections (add "STOP" if needed)

**2. Storage Locations**

- White lines outline where pallets, carts, containers go
- Label each location (A1, A2, B1, etc.)
- Part staging areas (this job, that job—separate and labeled)

**3. Safety Zones**

- Red lines around fire extinguishers (keep clear)
- Red/white stripes at dock edges (fall hazard)
- Yellow/black stripes at pinch points or overhead hazards

**4. Work Cell Boundaries**

- White or blue lines define cell area
- Keeps materials and equipment within cell
- Clear ownership

**5. 5S Marking**

- Outline locations for tools, equipment, waste bins
- Shadow effect (tool shape on floor where cart/bin goes)

**Materials:**

- **Tape**: Easy to apply, low cost, wears with traffic
  - Use industrial-grade floor tape (3M, Brady)
  - Clean and dry surface before application

- **Paint**: More durable, but harder to change
  - Use floor paint with stencil
  - Add non-slip grit for safety

- **Epoxy**: Very durable (for high-traffic areas)
  - Professional application recommended

**Maintenance:**

- Inspect regularly (quarterly)
- Re-tape or repaint worn areas
- Keep lines clean and visible

### 23.9.2.2 Color Coding Systems

**Color coding** provides instant visual identification.

**Applications:**

**1. Material Identification**

- **Aluminum** = Blue tags/labels
- **Steel** = Red tags/labels
- **Stainless Steel** = Green tags/labels
- **Brass** = Yellow tags/labels

Operators see color → know material instantly.

**2. Tool Identification**

- **Roughing tools** = Blue tape on holder
- **Finishing tools** = Red tape on holder
- **Threading tools** = Green tape on holder

**3. Area Assignment**

- **Cell 1** = Yellow (tools, carts, operators marked yellow)
- **Cell 2** = Green
- **Cell 3** = Blue

Prevents mixing of tools and equipment between cells.

**4. Status Identification**

- **Green tag** = Inspected, approved (ready to ship)
- **Yellow tag** = Hold for inspection
- **Red tag** = Nonconforming (do not use/ship)

**5. Calibration Status**

- **Green dot** = In calibration (good to use)
- **Yellow dot** = Calibration due soon
- **Red dot** = Out of calibration (do not use)

**Implementation:**

- **Consistent system**: Use same colors throughout shop (document in standard)
- **Train employees**: Everyone understands color meanings
- **Maintain**: Replace faded or worn color coding

### 23.9.2.3 Signs and Labels

**Signs** communicate rules, directions, information, and warnings.

**Types:**

**1. Safety Signs**

OSHA/ANSI standards:
- **Danger** (red/black/white): Immediate hazard, death or serious injury
- **Warning** (orange/black): Potential hazard, injury possible
- **Caution** (yellow/black): Minor hazard, reminder
- **Notice** (blue/white): General information, instructions

Examples:
- "DANGER: High Voltage"
- "WARNING: Forklift Traffic"
- "CAUTION: Wear Safety Glasses"
- "NOTICE: Emergency Exit"

**2. Directional Signs**

- Arrows pointing to destinations
- "Shipping →"
- "Restrooms ←"
- "Emergency Exit ↑"

**3. Identification Signs**

- Machine names/numbers: "Lathe 3", "Mill 5-Axis"
- Area labels: "Inspection Lab", "Tool Crib"
- Storage labels: "Raw Material - Aluminum", "Finished Goods - Customer ABC"

**4. Instructional Signs**

- Process reminders: "Turn off coolant before opening door"
- Quality reminders: "Inspect first piece"
- 5S reminders: "Clean your area before leaving"

**5. Status Signs**

- "IN SERVICE" / "OUT OF SERVICE"
- "CALIBRATED" / "OUT OF CAL - DO NOT USE"
- "APPROVED" / "HOLD" / "REJECT"

**Best Practices:**

- **Concise**: Short, clear messages
- **Visual**: Use symbols/pictograms when possible
- **Durable**: Laminated, metal, or engraved (won't fade/damage)
- **Visible**: Proper size, location, contrast
- **Consistent**: Same format and style throughout facility

### 23.9.2.4 Shadow Boards

**Shadow Boards** (covered extensively in Section 23.3.4 - 5S) are a primary visual management tool.

**Quick Recap:**

- Tool outline painted on board
- Tool hangs in designated spot
- Empty shadow instantly visible → tool missing

**Applications Beyond Tools:**

**1. Inspection Gages**

Shadow board at inspection station:
- Micrometer, calipers, indicators in outlined positions
- Missing gage immediately obvious

**2. Safety Equipment**

- First aid kit contents
- Fire extinguisher location (outline on wall)
- PPE (safety glasses, gloves)

**3. Maintenance Tools**

- Specific tools for machine maintenance
- Ensures complete tool set available

**4. Cleaning Equipment**

- Broom, dustpan, spray bottle
- Outline on wall or cart

**Benefits:**

### 23.9.3.3 Andon Systems

**Andon** (Japanese: "lantern"): Visual signal for status and alerts.

**Origin**: Toyota Production System—operators signal when help needed.

**Implementation in CNC Shops:**

**1. Machine Status Lights** (Traffic Lights)

Mounted on top of machine:
- **Green**: Running normally
- **Yellow**: Attention needed (tool change coming, operator needed soon)
- **Red**: Stopped (problem, out of material, setup)

Visible across shop floor.

**2. Pull Cord/Button**

Operator pulls cord or presses button:
- Lights andon (yellow or red)
- Alerts supervisor or maintenance
- Stops line (if critical issue in flow production)

**3. Display Board**

Central andon board shows status of all machines:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐

---

## 23.9.5 Visual Inspection Aids

**Visual Inspection Aids**: Tools that make quality acceptance criteria obvious.

### Types of Visual Aids

**1. Go/No-Go Gages**

- Physical gage with "GO" and "NO-GO" ends
- Part fits in GO side = good
- Part fits in NO-GO side = bad
- No measurement reading needed—binary pass/fail

**2. Color-Coded Limit Gages**

- Dial indicator with colored zones
- Green zone = in tolerance
- Red zone = out of tolerance
- Operator sees color, not number

**3. Overlay Templates**

- Clear plastic template with part outline and critical features
- Lay over part—visual comparison
- Quickly see if dimensions and features correct

**4. Sample Parts**

- Golden sample (perfect part) displayed
- "Match this part"
- Good for visual features (surface finish, edge breaks, appearance)

**5. Visual Defect Charts**

- Poster showing acceptable vs. unacceptable conditions
- Photos of good parts, bad parts (various defects)
- "If part looks like this → reject"

**6. Marked Measuring Tools**

- Tape measure or ruler with tolerance zone marked
- E.g., Length spec: 10.000" ± 0.020"
- Mark green zone from 9.980" to 10.020" on ruler
- Operator aligns, sees if part lands in green

**Example Visual Defect Chart:**

```
