## 22.6.1 Supplier Selection and Evaluation

**Supplier Selection**: Process of identifying and qualifying suppliers capable of meeting requirements

### Importance of Supplier Selection

**Quality Risks from Poor Suppliers**:
- Defective materials (wrong alloy, out-of-spec dimensions)
- Inconsistent quality (lot-to-lot variation)
- Counterfeit materials (especially in aerospace)
- Process failures (heat treatment out of spec, plating defects)
- Supply disruptions (late deliveries, shortages)

**Your Quality = Supplier's Quality**:
- Cannot inspect quality into product after materials arrive
- Prevention through qualified suppliers more effective than inspection
- Customer holds you responsible regardless of supplier issues

### Types of Suppliers

**Material Suppliers**:
- Raw materials (bar stock, plate, castings, forgings)
- Metal distributors vs. mills
- Specialty materials (aerospace alloys, medical-grade)

**Outside Service Providers**:
- Heat treatment
- Plating and coating
- Welding, grinding, EDM
- NDT (non-destructive testing)
- Calibration services

**Tooling and Consumables**:
- Cutting tools (end mills, drills, inserts)
- Abrasives (grinding wheels, sandpaper)
- Coolant, lubricants, chemicals
- Gages and measuring equipment

- Comprehensive assessment of QMS and capabilities

**2. Surveillance Audit**:
- Periodic audit of approved suppliers (annually, every 2-3 years)
- Verify continued compliance and performance

**3. For-Cause Audit**:
- Triggered by problems (defects, delivery issues, nonconformances)
- Investigate root causes and verify corrective actions

**4. Process Audit**:
- Focused on specific process (not entire QMS)
- Example: Audit heat treatment process at supplier

**5. Product Audit**:
- Inspect product at supplier before shipment
- Verify quality before delivery (high-risk or first-time orders)

### Supplier Audit Process

**1. Audit Planning**:
- Define audit scope (QMS, specific process, product)
- Select audit team (lead auditor, technical expert if needed)
- Review supplier information (previous audits, quality manual, recent performance)
- Prepare audit checklist
- Schedule with supplier (2-4 weeks advance notice)
- Send audit plan to supplier

**2. Opening Meeting**:
- Introductions (audit team, supplier management and escorts)
- Confirm scope and schedule
- Explain audit process
- Tour of facility

**3. Audit Execution**:
- Interview personnel (management, operators, inspectors, quality)
- Observe processes (manufacturing, inspection, testing)
- Review documents (procedures, work instructions, control plans)
- Review records (inspection records, calibration, training, nonconformances)
- Collect evidence (photos, copies of records)

**4. Audit Findings**:
- **Conformance**: Process meets requirements
- **Nonconformance**: Failure to meet requirement (major or minor)
- **Observation**: Opportunity for improvement (not yet nonconformance)

**Finding Documentation**:
- Describe finding clearly
- Cite requirement (ISO 9001 clause, specification, procedure)
- Provide objective evidence (what was observed, records reviewed)

**Example Findings**:

*Major Nonconformance*: "Three of five heat treatment furnaces have no record of temperature uniformity survey in past 12 months. AMS 2750 requires annual TUS. (Nonconformance to AMS 2750 Section 3.2.2)"

*Minor Nonconformance*: "Calibration sticker on micrometer S/N 12345 shows due date of 15-MAR-2024, but current date is 22-MAR-2024 (7 days overdue). (Nonconformance to ISO 9001 Clause 7.1.5.1)"

*Observation*: "Work instructions at machining station are printed on paper and showing wear/staining from coolant exposure. Consider laminating or providing digital display to preserve legibility."

**5. Closing Meeting**:
- Present findings to supplier management
- Discuss nonconformances and observations
- Supplier may provide clarifications or immediate corrective actions
- Discuss next steps (corrective action plan, follow-up)

**6. Audit Report**:
- Executive summary
- Audit scope and dates
- Audit team and supplier attendees
- Findings (detailed description of each conformance, nonconformance, observation)
- Recommendations
- Approval and distribution

**7. Corrective Action Follow-Up**:
- Supplier submits corrective action plan (CAP) within specified timeframe (30 days typical)
- CAP includes:
  - Immediate containment (if applicable)
  - Root cause analysis
  - Corrective action to prevent recurrence
  - Completion date
- Auditor reviews and approves CAP
- Follow-up verification (document review, re-audit, or next surveillance audit)

### Supplier Audit Frequency

**Frequency Based on Risk**:

| Risk Level | Audit Frequency | Criteria |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| Critical | Annually | Special processes (heat treat, plating, welding); safety-critical materials; sole-source; poor performance history |
| High | Every 2 years | Key suppliers; significant quality impact; moderate performance |
| Medium | Every 3 years | Routine suppliers; good performance; ISO 9001 certified |
| Low | As needed | Commodity items; excellent performance; minimal risk |

**Factors Increasing Audit Frequency**:
- Lack of certification (ISO 9001)
- Quality issues or nonconformances
- New supplier (audit within 1st year)
- Customer requirement (some aerospace customers require annual supplier audits)

**Factors Decreasing Audit Frequency**:
- Excellent performance (zero defects, on-time delivery)
- Strong certifications (ISO 9001, AS9100, Nadcap)
- Low-risk commodity items
- Long history of satisfactory performance

### Remote Audits

**Remote (Virtual) Audits**:
- Conducted via video conference

## 22.6.4 Incoming Inspection and Receiving Procedures

Incoming inspection verifies that purchased materials and services meet specified requirements before use in production.

### Purpose of Incoming Inspection

**Catch Defects Early**:
- Prevent defective materials from entering production (causing scrap, rework, delays)
- Less costly to reject at receiving than discover after machining

**Verify Supplier Performance**:
- Confirm supplier quality claims
- Detect supplier process problems
- Provide data for supplier scorecard

**Traceability**:
- Verify material certifications
- Link received material to purchase order and job

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Counterfeit material detection (aerospace)
- Regulatory compliance verification (DFARS, RoHS, REACH)

### Incoming Inspection Levels

**Level of Inspection Depends on Risk**:

**1. No Inspection** (low risk):
- Commodity items (office supplies, consumables)
- Trusted suppliers with excellent history
- Non-critical items

**2. Document Review Only** (low-medium risk):
- Verify packing slip and certifications received
- No physical inspection
- Suitable for certified suppliers with good history

**3. Visual and Dimensional Checks** (medium risk):
- Visual inspection (damage, correct material, markings)
- Basic dimensional checks (diameter, length of stock)
- Material certifications reviewed

**4. Full Inspection** (high risk):
- Detailed dimensional inspection
- Material verification (chemical analysis, hardness)
- First Article Inspection (FAI) for new suppliers or products
- Critical materials (aerospace, medical)

**5. Source Inspection** (critical risk):
- Inspect at supplier location before shipment
- Used for high-value, critical, or one-time purchases
- Ensures quality before expensive shipping

### Incoming Inspection Procedure

**1. Receive Shipment**:
- Receiving department accepts delivery
- Check for obvious damage (boxes crushed, crate damaged)
- Sign delivery receipt

**2. Verify Shipment**:
- Match packing slip to purchase order (PO)
- Verify part number, quantity, supplier
- Check for required documentation (certifications, test reports)

**3. Hold for Inspection**:
- Material segregated in "Incoming Inspection" area
- Tagged "HOLD - AWAITING INSPECTION"
- Not released to production until approved

**4. Perform Inspection**:
- Inspector retrieves PO and specifications
- Performs inspection per incoming inspection plan

**Typical Inspection Checks**:

**Visual Inspection**:
- Correct material (verify markings, color, appearance)
- Condition (corrosion, damage, defects)
- Quantity (count or weigh)
- Packaging (adequate protection)

**Dimensional Inspection**:
- Verify stock dimensions (diameter, thickness, length)
- Sample inspection (measure representative samples)
- Use calipers, micrometer, tape measure

**Material Verification**:
- Review material certification (MTR - Material Test Report)
  - Verify heat lot number on material matches certification
  - Confirm alloy, specification (e.g., 6061-T6, AMS 4027)
  - Check chemical composition and mechanical properties on MTR
- Physical/chemical testing (for critical materials):
  - PMI (Positive Material Identification): XRF analyzer verifies alloy
  - Hardness testing: Verify heat treatment condition
  - Tensile testing: For critical applications (sample basis)

**Documentation Verification**:
- Certifications complete and accurate
- Traceability information (heat lot, batch number)
- Compliance statements (DFARS, RoHS, REACH)
- Test reports (if required)

**5. Acceptance Decision**:
- **Accept**: Material meets all requirements
  - Tag "APPROVED" or "RELEASED"
  - Move to stock or production area
  - Update inventory system
- **Reject**: Material does not meet requirements
  - Tag "REJECTED"
  - Segregate in reject area
  - Issue supplier corrective action request (SCAR)
  - Return to supplier or scrap
- **Conditional Accept** (use-as-is):
  - Minor nonconformance
  - Requires engineering/quality approval
  - Document deviation and justification

**6. Documentation**:
- Incoming inspection report (paper or electronic)
  - PO number, supplier, material description
  - Inspection results (dimensions, visual observations)
  - Accept/reject decision
  - Inspector signature and date
- Retain certifications with receiving records
- Link material lot to jobs where used (traceability)

### Reduced Inspection

**Reduced Inspection Programs**:
- For suppliers with proven performance, reduce inspection intensity
- Saves time and cost

**Criteria for Reduced Inspection**:
- Supplier certified (ISO 9001, AS9100)
- Scorecard rating ≥90 for 6-12 months
- Zero defects in recent history (e.g., last 20 lots)
- Low-risk material

**Reduced Inspection Levels**:
- **Skip-lot inspection**: Inspect every 5th or 10th lot (others dock to stock)
- **Sample inspection**: Inspect reduced sample size
- **Document review only**: Verify certifications without physical inspection
- **Dock-to-stock**: Material released directly to production without inspection (highest trust)

**Monitoring**:
- Continue tracking supplier performance
- Return to full inspection if defects found or performance declines

**Example Policy**:
> Suppliers rated ≥95 on scorecard for 6 consecutive months with zero defects qualify for skip-lot inspection (inspect 1 in 5 lots, document review only for others). If any lot rejected, return to 100% inspection for 6 months.

### Handling Nonconforming Purchased Materials

**When Material Rejected at Incoming Inspection**:

**1. Segregate and Identify**:
- Move to reject area (bonded cage, separate location)
- Red tag "REJECTED"
- Do not use in production

**2. Document Nonconformance**:
- Incoming inspection report shows rejection
- Nonconformance Report (NCR) issued
- Describe defect (dimensions out of spec, wrong material, damaged, missing certification)

**3. Notify Supplier**:
- Contact supplier immediately
- Provide details (PO, part number, quantity, defect description)
- Request corrective action

**4. Disposition**:
- **Return to Supplier**: Supplier credits or replaces (most common)
- **Use-As-Is**: Engineering determines defect acceptable (with customer concession if required)
- **Sort**: Separate good from bad (if some conforming)
- **Scrap**: If no value (often supplier pays scrap cost)

**5. Supplier Corrective Action Request (SCAR)**:
- Formal request for corrective action (see next section)

**6. Impact Mitigation**:
- Check inventory for alternate material
- Expedite replacement from supplier
- Seek alternate source if critical
- Communicate with customer if delivery impacted

---

## 22.6.5 Supplier Corrective Action Requests (SCAR)

**SCAR**: Formal notification to supplier of nonconformance requiring corrective action

### When to Issue SCAR

**Triggers**:
- Material rejected at incoming inspection
- Defect discovered during production (traced to supplier material)
- Delivery issues (chronic late deliveries)
- Documentation problems (missing or incorrect certifications)
- Multiple minor issues indicating systemic problem

**Not Every Defect Requires SCAR**:
- One-time isolated defects may be handled informally (phone call, email)
- SCAR for recurring issues or significant problems

### SCAR Process

**1. Initiate SCAR**:
- Quality Manager or Purchasing issues SCAR to supplier
- SCAR form sent via email (often fillable PDF)

  - Stop shipments if necessary
  - Inspect remaining inventory
  - Identify potentially affected shipments to other customers
- **Formal Response** (10-30 days): Corrective action plan
  - Root cause analysis (5 Whys, Fishbone, etc.)
  - Corrective action to prevent recurrence
  - Preventive action for similar issues
  - Timeline for implementation
  - Effectiveness verification plan

**3. Review Supplier Response**:
- Quality Manager reviews supplier's corrective action plan
- **Acceptable**: Approve plan, close SCAR
- **Not Acceptable**: Reject, request revised plan (inadequate root cause, corrective action insufficient)

**4. Verify Effectiveness**:
- Monitor subsequent shipments
- Verify corrective action implemented
- If issue recurs, re-open SCAR or escalate

**5. Close SCAR**:
- Corrective action verified effective
- Document closure (date, approval)
- Update supplier scorecard

> 6. First Article Inspection per AS9102 required before production shipment; submit FAI package for approval
> 7. Certificate of Conformance required with each shipment
> 8. Customer reserves right to access supplier facility for audits or source inspection with 48 hours notice
> 9. Supplier must notify customer within 24 hours of any nonconformances affecting delivered product

### PO Review and Approval

**Internal Review Before Issuing PO**:
- Engineering: Verify specifications correct and complete
- Quality: Verify quality requirements and flow-down included
- Purchasing: Verify supplier on ASL, pricing, delivery

**PO Acknowledgment by Supplier**:
- Supplier reviews and acknowledges acceptance of PO terms
- If unable to meet requirements, supplier notifies immediately (negotiate or cancel)

**Changes to PO**:
- Changes issued as PO revision or Change Order
- Both parties agree to changes
- Quality review if technical changes

## Summary

Supplier quality management is critical to overall product quality and business success. Effective supplier management includes careful selection and qualification, ongoing performance monitoring, incoming inspection, and corrective action when issues arise. Clear communication of requirements through purchase orders and collaboration on improvement ensures suppliers deliver conforming materials and services consistently.

Strong supplier relationships built on mutual trust, transparency, and commitment to quality benefit both parties. Treating suppliers as partners rather than adversaries leads to better quality, innovation, and long-term success.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Supplier selection** should evaluate technical capability, quality system, cost, delivery, financial stability, and risk
2. **Supplier evaluation methods** include desktop review, trial orders, and on-site audits
3. **Approved Supplier List (ASL)** limits purchasing to qualified suppliers
4. **Supplier audits** verify QMS and processes; frequency based on risk and performance
5. **Supplier performance monitoring** uses metrics (quality PPM, on-time delivery, responsiveness) and scorecards
6. **Incoming inspection** verifies materials meet requirements before use; level based on risk
7. **Reduced inspection** programs reward excellent suppliers with less inspection burden
8. **Supplier Corrective Action Requests (SCAR)** formalize nonconformance and require root cause analysis and corrective action
9. **Purchase orders** must clearly communicate all requirements including specifications, documentation, traceability, and flow-down of customer/regulatory requirements
10. **Supplier relationships** should be collaborative partnerships, not adversarial
11. **Material certifications** (MTR, C of C) must be verified for accuracy and traceability
12. **Counterfeit prevention** especially critical for aerospace; purchase from authorized sources, verify certifications, test materials

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Supplier Evaluation

Evaluate a hypothetical supplier for approval:
1. Define material or service to be purchased (e.g., aluminum bar stock, heat treatment)
2. List evaluation criteria (capability, quality system, cost, delivery, risk)
3. Choose evaluation method (desktop, trial order, audit) with justification
4. Create supplier questionnaire (10 questions)
5. Define acceptance criteria for approval

### Exercise 2: Create Supplier Scorecard

Design a supplier scorecard:
1. Select 5 performance metrics (quality, delivery, cost, responsiveness, documentation)
2. Define calculation method for each metric
3. Set targets for each metric
4. Assign weights (totaling 100%)
5. Create scoring system (0-100 scale)
6. Define actions for different score ranges (excellent, good, marginal, unacceptable)
7. Fill in sample scorecard with realistic data

### Exercise 3: Develop Incoming Inspection Plan

Create incoming inspection plan for a material:
1. Select material type (bar stock, castings, purchased components)
2. List inspection checks (visual, dimensional, material verification, documentation)
3. Define acceptance criteria for each check
4. Specify required documentation (MTR, C of C, test reports)
5. Determine sample size (100%, sample, skip-lot)
6. Create inspection form or checklist

### Exercise 4: Write a SCAR

Draft a Supplier Corrective Action Request:
1. Identify nonconformance (reject incoming material, late delivery, missing certification)
2. Complete SCAR form with:
   - Description of problem (specific, detailed)
   - Quantity affected
   - Immediate action taken
   - Response requested from supplier (containment, root cause, corrective action)
   - Timeline
3. What would you look for in supplier's response?

### Exercise 5: Purchase Order Requirements

Create quality requirements section for a purchase order:
1. Select purchased item (machined part, raw material, outside service)
2. List all quality and technical requirements:
   - Specifications and standards
   - Documentation required
   - Traceability requirements
   - Certifications required
   - Flow-down requirements (regulatory, customer)
3. Write in clear, specific language suitable for PO
