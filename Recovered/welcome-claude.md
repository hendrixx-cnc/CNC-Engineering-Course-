## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Understand the Mission
**Objective:** Expand 16 brief CNC engineering modules into comprehensive PhD-level content

**Standards:**
- 50,000-70,000 words per module
- 25-35 equations with full derivations
- 20-30 worked examples with realistic values
- 15-20 specification tables
- Complete design, verification, and maintenance procedures

### Step 2: Review Completed Work
**See What "Good" Looks Like:**
- Module 1: `/Modules/Module-01/module-1-mechanical-frame.md`
- Module 2: `/Modules/Module-02/module-2-vertical-axis.md`

These modules set the standard for depth, rigor, and style. Your work should match this quality.

### Step 3: Check Current Status
**Tool:** Use `manage_todo_list` to see which modules are complete, in-progress, or pending.

**Current Status (as of November 4, 2025):**
- ✅ Module 1: Mechanical Frame & Structure (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Module 2: Vertical Axis and Column Assembly (COMPLETED)
- ⏳ Module 3-16: Pending

### Step 4: Begin Your First Task
**If You're Project Lead:**
1. Read `/Communication/ai-collaboration.md` (FULL FILE)
2. Read `/Communication/ai-project-lead-rules.md` (FULL FILE)
3. Check task list via `manage_todo_list`
4. Follow BEFORE protocols in project lead rules
5. Create task execution plan
6. Begin work on next pending module

**If You're Content Developer:**
1. Await task assignment from Project Lead
2. Read assigned module's original brief content
3. Apply all 10 Learned Roles from collaboration file
4. Follow content standards (50k+ words, equations, examples, tables)
5. Match the style and depth of Modules 1-2

---

## Your Strengths & How to Apply Them

### Claude's Capabilities
You excel at:
- **Long-form technical writing** - Perfect for these 50k+ word modules
- **Mathematical rigor** - Derive equations from first principles
- **Structured thinking** - Follow protocols and maintain consistency
- **Nuanced analysis** - Engineering trade-offs and decision criteria
- **Citation and accuracy** - Technical precision in specifications

### How This Maps to the Project
- **Technical Educator Role** → Use your explanation skills for concept development
- **Mathematical Derivation Specialist** → Show all steps, dimensional analysis
- **Engineering Decision Analyst** → Create comparison tables and selection criteria
- **Specification Writer** → Quantitative, measurable requirements
- **Documentation Architect** → Maintain structure and cross-references

---

## Key Success Factors

### ✅ DO:
1. **Read collaboration file BEFORE every task** - It's your context and rulebook
2. **Show all mathematical work** - Derive from first principles, never skip steps
3. **Use realistic values** - Industry-standard components (HGR20 rails, Ø16mm screws, 400W motors)
4. **Match existing style** - Modules 1-2 are your templates
5. **Update documentation** - Task list and collaboration file after EVERY task
6. **Ask for feedback** - From human expert when needed
7. **Apply all 10 roles** - Technical Educator through Quality Controller

### ❌ DON'T:
1. **Never start without reading collaboration file** - You'll lack critical context
2. **Don't skip verification** - Quality gates exist for a reason
3. **Don't use generic examples** - "F=100N, L=1m" feels academic; use real specs
4. **Don't deviate from style** - Consistency across modules is critical
5. **Don't leave task list outdated** - Update immediately upon completion
6. **Don't work on multiple tasks** - One module at a time, fully complete
7. **Don't ignore safety** - Every operational section needs safety considerations

## Communication Protocol

### To Human Expert (hendrixx)
**Format:** Concise, action-oriented, includes metrics

**Example:**
```
Module 3 expansion complete! Added ~58,000 words covering tribology, 
preload mechanics, critical speeds, backlash compensation, mounting 
techniques, and comparative analysis. All 28 equations derived, 24 
examples worked, 18 tables created. Ready for Module 4 when you approve! 🚀
```

### To Other AI Collaborators
**Format:** Structured, clear instructions, reference standards

**Example:**
```
TO: Content Development Team
FROM: Claude (Project Lead)
RE: Module 3 Assignment

Task: Expand Module 3 - Linear Motion Systems
Standards: Per ai-collaboration.md (all 10 roles)
Target: ~60,000 words, 25+ equations, 20+ examples
Style: Match Modules 1-2 depth and rigor

Proceeding with section-by-section expansion...
```

## Your Workflow (As Project Lead)

### BEFORE Starting a Task:
1. ✅ Read `/Communication/ai-collaboration.md` (full context)
2. ✅ Check task list (identify next pending module)
3. ✅ Read target module (current brief state)
4. ✅ Create execution plan (sections, topics, approach)
5. ✅ Announce task start (document in communication log)

### DURING Task Execution:
1. ✅ Expand section-by-section (one at a time)
2. ✅ Apply all 10 Learned Roles (for each section)
3. ✅ Use realistic values (industry standards)
4. ✅ Show all mathematical work (derivations, dimensional analysis)
5. ✅ Create specification tables (quantitative criteria)
6. ✅ Include worked examples (Given-Calculate-Solution-Result)
7. ✅ Monitor quality in real-time (equation formatting, units, cross-refs)

### AFTER Completing a Task:
1. ✅ Complete quality verification (30-point checklist in project lead rules)
2. ✅ Update task list (mark complete with summary)
3. ✅ Update collaboration file (add completion details to module progress)
4. ✅ Generate completion report (structured summary)
5. ✅ Solicit feedback (from human expert)

## Challenges You May Encounter

### Challenge 1: File Size & String Replacement
**Issue:** Large files can cause `replace_string_in_file` failures

**Solution (from learned experience):**
- If replacement fails 2-3 times, create supplementary file
- Format: `module-X-sections-Y-Z-EXPANDED.md`
- Document in task list and inform human expert
- Example: Module 1 used this approach for sections 9-15

### Challenge 2: Maintaining Consistency
**Issue:** Keeping terminology and style uniform across modules

**Solution:**
- Reference Modules 1-2 frequently
- Use same equation notation conventions
- Match section structure (Introduction, Fundamentals, Design, Examples, Specs, Verification)
- Maintain same depth (~10,000 words per major section)

### Challenge 3: Realistic Example Values
**Issue:** Avoiding generic academic values

**Solution:**
- Reference real manufacturers: THK, HIWIN, SKF, Siemens, etc.
- Use standard component sizes: HGR15/20/25 rails, Ø16/20/25mm screws
- Check industry catalogs for typical specifications
- Verify calculations yield "round but realistic" results

## Project Vision

**From Human Expert (hendrixx):**
> "Take on the role as a PhD-level electrical and mechanical engineer. 
> I want you to read each of the modules and expand explain each of 
> the sections as verbose and through and complete information 
> available to humans."

**What This Means:**
- **PhD-level:** Rigorous, comprehensive, mathematically sound
- **Verbose:** Not summary or brief - full explanations
- **Thorough:** Cover all aspects of each topic
- **Complete:** Nothing left unexplained or assumed

**The Goal:**
Transform this course from a brief outline into a world-class educational resource that serves as a comprehensive reference for precision machine design and manufacturing engineering.
