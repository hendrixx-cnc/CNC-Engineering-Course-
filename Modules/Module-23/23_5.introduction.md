# Module 23 – Shop Organization and Management


## Introduction

**Material handling** is the movement, storage, control, and protection of materials throughout the manufacturing process. In CNC shops, this includes:

- Raw material (bar stock, plate, castings, forgings)
- Work-in-process (WIP) parts moving between operations
- Finished goods awaiting shipment
- Consumables (coolant, cutting tools, supplies)

**The Problem:**

Material handling is **non-value-added**—the customer doesn't pay for us to move things around the shop. Yet in many facilities, material handling consumes:
- 25-50% of labor hours
- 50-70% of floor space
- 30-40% of total operating costs

**The Goal:**

Minimize handling while ensuring materials are available when and where needed.

**This section covers:**
- Principles of efficient material handling
- Equipment selection
- Part routing and tracking
- Storage systems
- FIFO implementation
- Material identification and traceability

---

## 23.5.1 Material Handling Principles

These fundamental principles guide material handling design:

### 23.5.1.1 Minimize Handling and Movement

**Every move is waste.**

**Strategies:**

**1. Reduce Distance**
- Cellular layout: Operations close together
- Point-of-use storage: Material at machine, not central warehouse
- Direct delivery: Supplier delivers to point of use (milk run)

**2. Reduce Frequency**
- Larger containers (but not so large they create other problems)
- Batch operations together (reduce trips)

**3. Eliminate Moves**
- Combine operations (one setup instead of multiple)
- Re-sequence operations (avoid backtracking)
- Process at point of receipt (inspect material where it arrives)

**4. Use Gravity**
- Gravity conveyors (parts slide from operation to operation)
- Chutes (chips fall into bins)
- Roller rails (containers roll to next operation)

**Example:**

**Before**:
- Raw material in warehouse (500 ft from machine)
- Operator walks to warehouse, retrieves material (10 min)
- Carries back to machine (10 min)
- Total: 20 minutes per job

**After**:
- Material delivered to machine daily (by material handler)
- Stored in rack at machine (20 ft away)
- Operator retrieves material (1 min)
- Total: 1 minute per job → **95% reduction**

### 23.5.1.2 Right Equipment for the Job

**Match equipment to material characteristics:**

| Material Characteristic | Suitable Equipment |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| Light weight, small | Hand-carry, tote bins, small carts |
| Medium weight | Wheeled carts, dollies |
| Heavy, bulky | Forklift, pallet jack, crane/hoist |
| Long (bar stock, tubing) | Overhead crane, special cart with supports |
| Delicate, precision | Padded containers, specialized fixtures |

**Don't over-engineer:**
- Small parts don't need a forklift
- Heavy castings can't be hand-carried

**Don't under-engineer:**
- Manual lifting of heavy parts risks injury
- Inadequate equipment causes damage and delays

### 23.5.1.3 Ergonomics and Safety

**Material handling is a major source of injuries:**
- Back injuries from lifting
- Crushed fingers/feet from dropping parts
- Forklift accidents

**Ergonomic Principles:**

**1. Minimize Manual Lifting**
- Use hoists, cranes, lift tables for >50 lbs
- Team lifts for awkward parts
- Material at waist height (not floor or overhead)

**2. Reduce Reaching and Bending**
- Storage at 24"-48" height (knee to shoulder)
- Avoid floor-level storage (requires bending)
- Avoid overhead storage (requires reaching/stretching)

**3. Clear Pathways**
- Wide aisles (no obstacles)
- Good lighting
- Level floors (no tripping hazards)

**4. Proper Equipment**
- Carts with handles at comfortable height
- Wheels that roll easily (no straining to push)
- Gloves for sharp or rough materials

**Safety Principles:**

**1. Load Limits**
- Equipment rated for load (don't overload)
- Operators trained on safe limits
- Clearly marked load ratings on equipment

**2. Visibility**
- Clear sightlines (no blind corners)
- Mirrors at intersections
- Backup alarms on forklifts

**3. Traffic Control**
- Separate pedestrian and vehicle traffic (marked walkways)
- One-way aisles if practical
- Speed limits for forklifts

**4. Proper Training**
- Forklift certification required
- Safe lifting techniques
- Hazard awareness

## 23.5.3 Part Routing and Travelers

**Challenge**: Parts move through multiple operations—how do we ensure they go to the right places?

**Solution**: **Work Order Travelers** (or Routers, Job Packets)

### Work Order Travelers

**Traveler**: Document that accompanies part through all operations

**Information on Traveler:**

1. **Job Identification**
   - Work order number
   - Part number and description
   - Customer name
   - Quantity ordered

2. **Routing**
   - Sequence of operations (Op 10, 20, 30, etc.)
   - Machine or work center for each operation
   - Setup and run time (estimated)

3. **Quality Requirements**
   - Inspection points (first article, in-process, final)
   - Critical dimensions to check
   - Special requirements (heat treat, plating, certs)

4. **Material**
   - Material specification (alloy, size, heat lot)
   - Quantity of raw material issued

5. **Sign-Off**
   - Operator initials and date at each operation
   - Inspector sign-off at inspection points
   - Supervisor approval if needed

**Example Traveler Format:**

```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Physical Form:**

- **Paper**: Printed, clipped to container or hung with parts
  - Pros: Simple, no technology needed
  - Cons: Can get lost, damaged (coolant, dirt)

- **Laminated Card**: Reusable, wipe-clean
  - Pros: Durable, reusable for repeat jobs
  - Cons: Still physical (can be lost)

- **Digital Traveler**: Displayed on screen or tablet at each station
  - Pros: Never lost, real-time updates, data collection
  - Cons: Requires technology (MES software, tablets, network)

### Part Identification Tags

In addition to traveler, parts themselves should be tagged:

- **Job number**: Links to traveler and work order
- **Quantity**: How many parts in container
- **Operation**: Current or next operation
- **Date**: When operation completed

**Tag Example:**

```
┌──────────────────┐
│ WO: 25-0132      │
│ Part: 45678-A    │
│ Qty: 50          │
│ Next Op: 30      │
│ Machine: Lathe-3 │
└──────────────────┘
```

Attached to container (zip tie, wire, adhesive).

## 23.5.4 Rack and Storage Systems

### 23.5.4.1 Raw Material Racks

**Cantilever Racks**: For bar stock, tubing, extrusions

- Arms extend from vertical posts
- Material rests on multiple arms
- Easy access from front
- Can be single-sided (against wall) or double-sided (freestanding)

**Design:**
- Arm length matches material length
- Spacing between arms prevents sagging
- Vertical spacing allows forklift access
- Load capacity clearly marked

**Organization:**
- Group by material type (aluminum, steel, stainless)
- Sub-group by shape and size
- Label each bay
- FIFO: Oldest material in front

**Sheet Racks**: For plate, sheet stock

- Vertical dividers create slots
- Sheets stored on edge (prevent warping)
- Pull sheet forward to retrieve

**Design:**
- Dividers every 6-12" (prevent leaning/falling)
- Capacity for sheet size (4x8, 5x10, etc.)
- Forklift or crane access

**Organization:**
- By material type and thickness
- Label each slot
- FIFO arrangement

### 23.5.4.2 WIP (Work in Progress) Storage

**Challenge**: Parts between operations need temporary storage

**Goals**:
- Minimize WIP (tied-up capital, space)
- Protect parts (no damage)
- Easy retrieval (find next job quickly)

**Storage Options:**

**1. Flow Racks**

- Gravity-fed (parts slide forward as front removed)
- FIFO automatic
- High visibility (see what's available)

**Best for**: Small to medium parts, high-volume flow

**2. Shelving with Bins**

- Adjustable shelves
- Tote bins or trays for parts
- Labeled by job or part number

**Best for**: Variety of part sizes, moderate volume

**3. Floor Storage with Carts**

- Rolling carts hold WIP
- Carts move with job (stay at machine or between operations)
- Labeled with job traveler

**Best for**: Larger parts, lower volume

**4. Kanban Supermarket**

- Dedicated storage for standard/repeat parts
- Organized like a store (lanes by part number)
- Kanban cards signal replenishment

**Best for**: Repetitive production, pull systems

**Organization:**

- **By due date**: Next due out in front (ship soonest first)
- **By customer**: Group by customer (easy to pull orders)
- **By operation**: Current operation grouping (easier scheduling)

**Visual Management:**

- Color-coded tags by status:
  - Green: On schedule
  - Yellow: Caution (due soon)
  - Red: Urgent (late or rush)

### 23.5.4.3 Finished Goods Storage

**Purpose**: Hold completed parts awaiting shipment

**Organization**:

**By Due Date**: Ship date order
- Next to ship in most accessible location
- Far out dates in back
- Prevents shipping wrong order

**By Customer**: Customer grouping
- Easy to pick complete order
- Good for customers with multiple part numbers

**By Part Number**: SKU organization
- Useful if same parts ship to multiple customers
- Easy inventory management

**Storage Types:**

**1. Shelving**: For small parts in bins/boxes
**2. Pallet Racks**: For palletized goods
**3. Flow Racks**: FIFO, high turnover items
**4. Floor Storage**: Large or odd-shaped items

**Protection:**

- Bins, boxes, or bags (prevent damage, contamination)
- Covered storage (dust-free)
- Separate from work areas (no chips, coolant)
- Climate control if needed (prevent corrosion)

**Quality Hold**:

- Separate area for parts awaiting inspection or approval
- Clearly marked "Hold" or "Quarantine"
- Not accessible for shipping until released

---

## 23.5.5 FIFO (First In, First Out) Systems

**FIFO**: Oldest inventory used first

**Why FIFO Matters:**

1. **Prevent Obsolescence**: Old material doesn't sit forever
2. **Material Degradation**: Some materials age (rubber seals, adhesives, coatings)
3. **Quality**: Older inventory may have issues (corrosion, contamination)
4. **Accounting**: Inventory valuation more accurate
5. **Traceability**: Maintain chronological order for lot tracking

### Implementing FIFO

**1. Physical Arrangement**

**Flow Racks**:
- Load from back, retrieve from front
- Gravity ensures oldest is in front
- Foolproof FIFO

**Standard Racks**:
- Date labels: Receive date visible
- Organize front-to-back (oldest in front)
- Training: Always take from front

**2. Date Labeling**

Mark every item with:
- Receive date or "Use by" date
- Lot or batch number
- Clear, visible label

**3. Visual Indicators**

Color-coded by date range:
- January = Red
- February = Blue
- March = Green
- Etc.

Easy to spot oldest (different color).

**4. Audits**

Periodic checks:
- Verify FIFO is followed
- Check for old inventory (dusty, faded labels)
- Identify slow movers

**5. Alerts**

Expired or aging material:
- Yellow tag: Approaching age limit (use soon)
- Red tag: Expired or obsolete (review for disposition)

### FIFO Challenges

**1. Incompatible Parts**: Different jobs need different material
- **Solution**: FIFO within each material type/size (not across all material)

**2. Partial Usage**: Cut some material from bar, rest remains
- **Solution**: Label remainder with date and quantity; return to proper location

**3. Rush Jobs**: Need specific material, skip FIFO
- **Solution**: Minimize (plan ahead), but document when it happens

**4. Multiple Locations**: Same material in multiple places
- **Solution**: Centralize or use inventory system to track all locations

---

## 23.5.6 Material Identification and Traceability

**Identification**: What is it?

**Traceability**: Where did it come from, where did it go?

### Material Identification

**Every piece of material must be identified:**

1. **Material Type**: Alloy, grade (e.g., 6061-T6 Aluminum)
2. **Size**: Dimensions (e.g., 1.0 x 2.0 x 12.0)
3. **Heat Lot or Batch**: For traceability
4. **Supplier**: Who provided it
5. **Receive Date**: When it arrived

**Identification Methods:**

**1. Labels**

Adhesive or tie-on labels:
- Pre-printed or handwritten
- Durable (won't fall off or fade)
- Include all required info

**2. Metal Tags**

Attached with wire:
- Very durable (won't damage in handling)
- Reusable if laminated

**3. Marking (Stamping, Engraving)**

Permanent mark on material:
- Heat lot stamped on end of bar
- Can't be lost or mixed up
- May not be practical for all shapes

**4. Color Coding**

Paint or tape:
- Quick visual identification
- Supplement to labels (not replacement)
- Example: Aluminum = Blue, Steel = Red, Stainless = Green

**5. Barcodes or RFID**

Scannable identification:
- Quick, accurate data capture
- Links to database (detailed info)
- Requires scanners and software

### Material Traceability

**Traceability**: Linking material through the supply chain and production

**Why Traceability?**

1. **Quality Issues**: Recall material if defect discovered
2. **Regulatory**: Aerospace (AS9100), Medical (ISO 13485), Automotive (IATF 16949) require traceability
3. **Customer Requirements**: Provide material certs and heat lot documentation
4. **Legal**: Liability if part fails (prove correct material was used)

**Traceability Chain:**

**1. Receiving**:
- Document heat lot on receiving record
- Link to PO and supplier
- Attach label to material (heat lot visible)

**2. Storage**:
- Material stored with identification intact
- Inventory system tracks location and quantity

**3. Issue to Job**:
- Record heat lot on work order traveler
- Link material to specific job and part numbers

**4. Manufacturing**:
- Traveler stays with parts (maintains link to material)
- If parts combined or split, maintain identification

**5. Inspection and Test**:
- Document heat lot on inspection records
- Material certs filed with quality records

**6. Shipment**:
- Provide material certifications to customer (if required)
- Document which heat lots were in shipment

**Serialization (Full Traceability):**

For critical parts (aerospace, medical):
- Each part has unique serial number
- Links to specific material, operations, inspections, operator, date
- Complete history traceable

**Electronic Traceability Systems:**

- ERP or MES software tracks material from receipt through shipment
- Barcode scanning at each transaction (receive, issue, completion)
- Automatic documentation and reports

**Manual Traceability:**

- Paper records (receiving logs, travelers, inspection reports)
- Filed by job or part number
- More labor-intensive, but functional

## Summary

Material handling and flow are critical to CNC shop efficiency. Key principles include minimizing handling, using appropriate equipment, and prioritizing ergonomics and safety.

Effective material handling systems include:
- **Appropriate equipment**: Carts, forklifts, cranes matched to material characteristics
- **Part routing and travelers**: Ensure parts flow correctly through operations
- **Organized storage**: Raw material, WIP, and finished goods logically arranged
- **FIFO systems**: Oldest material used first, preventing obsolescence
- **Material identification and traceability**: Every item identified, full traceability through production

By applying these principles and systems, CNC shops reduce wasted time, improve safety, lower costs, and meet customer and regulatory requirements.

In the next sections of Module 23, we'll explore production planning and scheduling, inventory management, and other aspects of shop organization.
