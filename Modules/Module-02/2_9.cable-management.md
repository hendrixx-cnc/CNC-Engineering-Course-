# Module 2 – Vertical Axis & Z-Stage


## Overview

Vertical axis cable management presents unique challenges: cables must travel with the moving carriage while avoiding snagging, minimizing strain, and resisting gravity's tendency to pull cables downward. This section covers cable carrier selection, routing strategies, and strain relief techniques specific to Z-axis applications.

## Cable Types and Requirements

### Power Cables

**Motor power:**
- 3-phase for servo motors (4-wire plus ground)
- AWG 18-14 typical for NEMA 17-34
- Continuous flex rated (millions of cycles)

**Spindle power:**
- AWG 12-8 for 1.5-7.5kW spindles
- VFD output (high dV/dt, requires shielding)
- Separate from signal cables

### Signal Cables

**Encoder feedback:**
- Differential signals (RS-422 typical)
- Twisted-pair, shielded
- Low capacitance (<100 pF/m)
- Keep <3m total length

**Limit switches / Home sensors:**
- 22-24 AWG
- Shielded to prevent EMI

**Temperature sensors:**
- Thermocouple or RTD extension wire
- Shielded, keep away from power cables

### Fluid Lines

**Spindle coolant:**
- 6-10mm ID flexible hose
- Rated for coolant temperature and pressure
- Quick-disconnects for serviceability

**Lubrication lines:**
- 4-6mm tubing for automatic lubrication systems
- Low-pressure (<10 bar)

## Cable Carrier Systems

### Carrier Types

**Plastic drag chain:**
- Most common for small-medium machines
- Low cost ($2-5/ft)
- Quiet operation
- Adequate for most applications

**Steel cable carrier:**
- Heavy-duty applications
- Higher cost ($10-20/ft)
- Better for long travels (>2m)
- Oil/coolant resistant

**Spiral wrap / Conduit:**
- Lightweight, flexible
- Not suitable for Z-axis (gravity pulls loops)
- Use only for stationary routing

### Carrier Sizing

**Internal dimensions:**

$$A_{required} = \frac{\sum A_{cables}}{0.4}$$

Fill ratio: 40% maximum (allows cable movement, prevents binding)

**Example:**
- 4× AWG 18 power: 4× 8 mm² = 32 mm²
- 2× shielded twisted pair: 2× 12 mm² = 24 mm²
- 1× coolant hose: 80 mm² (10mm OD)
- Total: 136 mm²
- Required carrier area: 136 / 0.4 = 340 mm²

Select 25×25mm carrier (internal area = 625 mm², adequate margin)

### Bend Radius

**Minimum bend radius:**

$$R_{min} = 10 \times D_{largest\\_cable}$$

Conservative guideline ensures long cable life.

**Example:**
- Largest cable: 10mm OD coolant hose
- Minimum radius: 100mm
- Selected carrier: 150mm radius (safety margin)

## Mounting Configurations

### Top-Mounted Carrier (Recommended)

```
    Column
        |
    [Fixed end]
        |
      Cable
      Carrier ← Moves with carriage
        |
    [Moving end]
        |
    Carriage
```

**Advantages:**
- Gravity assists cable return (reduces wear)
- Clean appearance
- Protected from chips/coolant

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires space above column
- More complex mounting at top

### Side-Mounted Carrier

**Carrier mounted to side of column:**
- Works when top mounting not feasible
- Requires rigid carrier support bracket
- Gravity pulls carrier outward (support every 300-500mm)

### Internal Carrier (Advanced)

**Carrier routed inside hollow column:**
- Clean external appearance
- Maximum protection
- Difficult to service
- Requires larger column cross-section

## Installation Best Practices

### Fixed End Mounting

**Anchor point (top of column or machine frame):**
- Rigid mounting (no deflection)
- Strain relief for all cables exiting carrier
- Cable ties every 100mm
- Drip loop for coolant lines (lowest point before entry)

### Moving End Mounting

**Carriage attachment:**
- Secure mounting to carriage plate
- Flexible boot or conduit from carrier to components
- Allow 50-100mm extra cable length (service loop)
- Strain relief clamps at carrier exit

### Cable Routing Inside Carrier

**Layout strategy:**
1. Power cables on one side
2. Signal cables on opposite side (EMI separation)
3. Coolant hoses in center or separate chamber
4. Secure cables every 200-300mm inside carrier (prevent tangling)

**Avoid:**
- Mixing power and signal in same bundle
- Excessive tension on cables
- Sharp bends at carrier entry/exit
- Cables crossing over each other

## Strain Relief

### At Carrier Exits

**Fixed end:**
- 90° conduit fitting or cable gland
- Cable ties to support bracket
- Maintain bend radius
- Allow thermal expansion (don't over-tighten)

**Moving end:**
- Flexible conduit (last 150-200mm)
- Spiral wrap for small cables
- Service loop (coiled excess cable)
- Secure to carriage but allow slight movement

### At Component Connections

**Motor/spindle:**
- Connector with strain relief collar
- Cable clamped 100mm before connector
- No tension on connector pins
- Avoid sharp bends near connector

**Drives/electronics:**
- Cable entry through grommet or gland
- Secured to enclosure wall
- Drip loop before entry (if moisture possible)

## Vertical-Specific Considerations

### Gravity Effects

**Cable weight pulls downward:**
- Use lightweight cables when possible
- Support carrier at intervals (side-mount)
- Top-mount preferred (gravity assists)

**Coolant draining:**
- Route coolant hoses with continuous downward slope
- Avoid traps where fluid can pool
- Drip loop at lowest point

### Travel Length Calculation

**Carrier length:**

$$L_{carrier} = L_{travel} + 2 \times R_{bend} + L_{fixed} + L_{moving}$$

Where:
- $L_{travel}$ = Z-axis travel
- $R_{bend}$ = carrier bend radius
- $L_{fixed}$ = fixed end length (typically 150-300mm)
- $L_{moving}$ = moving end length (typically 200-400mm)

**Example:**
- Z-travel: 400mm
- Bend radius: 150mm
- Fixed end: 200mm
- Moving end: 300mm
- Total carrier length: 400 + 2(150) + 200 + 300 = 1200mm

Order 1500mm carrier (allows adjustment)

### Dynamic Loading

**Acceleration forces:**
- Cables experience inertial loading during acceleration
- Secure cables inside carrier to prevent shifting
- Use cable separators if high-acceleration application

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Cable Wear

**Symptoms:** Frayed insulation, broken conductors

**Causes:**
- Bend radius too tight
- Cables rubbing against carrier edges
- Over-filled carrier (cables binding)

**Solutions:**
- Increase bend radius
- Add cable separators
- Route cables to avoid edges
- Reduce fill ratio

### Signal Interference

**Symptoms:** Encoder errors, erratic motion, noise on sensors

**Causes:**
- Power and signal cables not separated
- Inadequate shielding
- Ground loops

**Solutions:**
- Separate power and signal (opposite sides of carrier)
- Use shielded cables, ground shields at one end only
- Twisted pair for differential signals
- Ferrite beads on signal cables near drives

### Carrier Binding

**Symptoms:** Jerky motion, increased motor current, audible clicking

**Causes:**
- Carrier over-filled
- Misaligned carrier mounting
- Insufficient lubrication

**Solutions:**
- Reduce cable count or increase carrier size
- Realign carrier mounting (parallel to motion axis)
- Lubricate carrier links (plastic-compatible grease)

### Coolant Leaks

**Symptoms:** Dripping coolant, pooling in carrier

**Causes:**
- Inadequate hose strain relief
- Hose kinked or damaged
- Quick-disconnect leaking

**Solutions:**
- Add hose support near connections
- Replace damaged hose
- Use higher-quality quick-disconnects with seals
