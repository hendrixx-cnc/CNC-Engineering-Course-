# Module 23 – Shop Organization and Management


## 23.2.1 Principles of Facility Layout

Facility layout is the arrangement of machines, work areas, storage, and support functions within the physical space of the manufacturing facility. Good layout design minimizes waste, optimizes flow, and creates a safe, efficient work environment.

### Why Layout Matters

Poor layout creates:
- **Excessive transportation**: Parts travel unnecessary distances
- **Confusion**: Unclear flow, materials get lost
- **Congestion**: Bottlenecks and waiting
- **Safety issues**: Forklift traffic near work areas, poor visibility
- **Inefficiency**: Can't see problems, difficult supervision

Good layout provides:
- **Smooth flow**: Materials move logically from receiving to shipping
- **Minimal handling**: Shortest practical distances
- **Visibility**: Easy to see status and problems
- **Flexibility**: Can adapt to volume changes
- **Safety**: Clear pathways, separation of traffic
- **Scalability**: Room for growth

### 23.2.1.1 Process Flow and Material Movement

**Core Principle: Minimize Transportation**

Transportation is one of the seven wastes in Lean thinking. It adds no value—it only moves things. Every time material is transported:
- Time is consumed
- Risk of damage increases
- Risk of mix-up or loss increases
- Labor or equipment cost is incurred

**Ideal Flow Characteristics:**

1. **Unidirectional**: Material flows one way, from receiving toward shipping
   - Avoids backtracking and cross-flow
   - Makes flow visible and predictable
   - Easier to track and control

2. **Minimal Distance**: Operations positioned close together
   - Reduce travel distance between consecutive operations
   - Position frequently-used resources centrally
   - Avoid isolated operations

3. **Straight Lines**: Avoid zigzag or circular patterns
   - Where operations must be linear, keep them straight
   - Reduces distance and confusion
   - Easier material handling

4. **Continuous**: Avoid stopping and starting
   - Design for flow, not batching
   - Position operations so work can move smoothly
   - Minimize queues between operations

**Material Movement Principles:**

- **Point of Use**: Store materials where they're used
  - Tools at the machine
  - Raw material near first operation
  - Inspection equipment at inspection station

- **Gravity**: Use gravity to move material when possible
  - Roller conveyors on slight decline
  - Chutes for chip removal
  - Parts slide from operation to operation

- **Eliminate**: Question every move
  - Can operations be combined?
  - Can operations be repositioned?
  - Is this movement necessary?

### 23.2.1.2 Value Stream Mapping

**Value Stream Mapping (VSM)** visualizes the entire flow of material and information from customer order to delivery.

**Steps to Create a VSM:**

1. **Define the Product Family**: Group products with similar processing
   - Example: "Aluminum bracket parts" or "Stainless shafts"

2. **Map Current State**: Walk the floor and document:
   - Each process step
   - Cycle time at each step
   - Queue time between steps
   - Number of operators
   - Number of parts in process
   - Information flow (how work is communicated)

3. **Calculate Key Metrics**:
   - **Lead Time**: Total time from order to delivery
   - **Processing Time**: Actual hands-on time adding value
   - **Process Efficiency**: Processing Time ÷ Lead Time × 100%

   Example:
   - Lead time: 2 weeks (10 working days = 4,800 minutes)
   - Processing time: 85 minutes (all operations combined)
   - Efficiency: 85 ÷ 4,800 × 100% = **1.8%**

   Typical CNC shops: 1-5% efficiency. **95-99% of time is waiting!**

4. **Identify Waste**:
   - Long queue times (waiting)
   - Excessive transportation
   - Rework loops
   - Inspection delays
   - Information delays

5. **Design Future State**: How could flow be improved?
   - Eliminate steps
   - Combine operations
   - Reduce queue times
   - Improve material flow
   - Faster information

6. **Create Implementation Plan**: Specific actions with timeline

**VSM Benefits:**
- Makes waste visible
- Provides common language for improvement
- Links operational improvements to business results
- Guides layout redesign decisions

### 23.2.1.3 Minimizing Transportation Waste

**Measurement and Analysis:**

1. **Spaghetti Diagram**: Track material movement
   - Draw facility layout to scale
   - Follow a part through all operations
   - Draw lines showing every movement
   - Result often looks like spaghetti—hence the name

   Analysis:
   - Total distance traveled
   - Backtracking (movement against main flow)
   - Cross-flows (paths that intersect)
   - Unnecessary movements (can they be eliminated?)

2. **From-To Chart**: Quantify movement between areas
   - Matrix showing # of moves from area A to area B
   - Identifies high-frequency movements that should be optimized
   - Reveals poor placement (high movement between distant areas)

**Strategies to Minimize Transportation:**

1. **Cellular Layout**: Group machines by product family
   - All operations for a product in one area
   - Minimal distance between operations
   - U-shaped cells for efficient flow

2. **Point-of-Use Storage**: Materials and tools where needed
   - Small quantities right at workstation
   - Replenished regularly
   - Eliminates trips to central storage

3. **Reduce Batch Size**: Smaller batches flow more easily
   - Large batches require forklifts and pallet storage
   - Small batches can be hand-carried or carted
   - Enables closer spacing of operations

4. **Dedicated Material Handlers**: Free operators from transportation
   - Operators stay at machines (value-adding)
   - Material handlers move parts (non-value but necessary)
   - Can be more efficient with dedicated equipment

5. **Mechanized Handling**: Conveyors, AGVs, robots
   - For high-volume, repetitive movements
   - Reduces labor and improves consistency
   - Requires capital investment

## 23.2.2 Machine Placement and Work Cell Design

How machines are arranged dramatically affects flow, efficiency, and quality.

### 23.2.2.1 U-Shaped Cells vs. Linear Layout

**Linear Layout (Traditional):**

```
[Machine 1] → → → [Machine 2] → → → [Machine 3] → → → [Machine 4]
     ↑                                                        ↓
  Receiving                                                Shipping
```

**Characteristics:**
- Long flow path
- Each machine operated by different person
- Large batches moved between operations
- High WIP inventory between machines
- Difficult for one person to operate multiple machines

**U-Shaped Cell Layout:**

```
         [Machine 1]
        ↙           ↘
  Receiving       [Machine 2]
        ↖           ↙
         [Machine 3]
        ↙           ↘
   Shipping      [Machine 4]
```

Or more compactly:

```
Raw Material In ↓
    [M1] → [M2]
      ↑       ↓
    [M4] ← [M3]
Finished Parts Out ↑
```

**Characteristics:**
- Operator walks inside the U
- Can tend multiple machines
- Short distances between machines
- Small batch sizes (or one-piece flow)
- Low WIP
- Receiving and shipping adjacent (easy for material handler)

**Advantages of U-Shaped Cells:**

1. **Operator Efficiency**: One person operates multiple machines
   - While Machine 1 runs, operator loads Machine 2
   - Continuous cycle
   - High utilization of labor

2. **Visual Management**: Operator sees all machines
   - Easily spots problems
   - Monitors quality throughout process
   - Maintains awareness

3. **Flexibility**: Easy to adjust staffing
   - High volume: 2-3 operators in cell
   - Low volume: 1 operator in cell
   - Adapts to demand

4. **Reduced WIP**: Short distances, small batches
   - Less floor space for queues
   - Less inventory investment
   - Faster throughput

5. **Quality Feedback**: Fast loop
   - Problem at Machine 3 immediately affects Machine 4
   - Rapid detection and correction
   - Prevents making many bad parts

**When to Use Linear Layout:**

- Very large machines that can't be moved close
- Very high volume (dedicated operators per machine)
- Different parts follow different routing (not product family)
- Existing facility constraints make cellular impractical

**When to Use U-Shaped Cells:**

- Product families with similar routing
- Multiple operations per part
- Moderate production volumes
- Desire for operator multi-tasking
- Limited floor space
- Emphasis on low WIP and fast throughput

### 23.2.2.2 One-Piece Flow Concepts

**One-Piece Flow** means producing and moving one part at a time through operations, rather than batches.

**Traditional Batch Flow:**
1. Machine 10 parts at Operation 1
2. Move batch to Operation 2
3. Machine 10 parts at Operation 2
4. Move batch to Operation 3
5. Etc.

**One-Piece Flow:**
1. Machine 1 part at Operation 1
2. Move immediately to Operation 2
3. Machine 1 part at Operation 2 (while next part starts at Op 1)
4. Move immediately to Operation 3
5. Continuous flow

**Benefits:**

1. **Reduced Lead Time**:
   - Batch: Must complete entire batch before moving → 10× cycle time
   - One-piece: Each part flows continuously → 1× cycle time + setup

2. **Less WIP Inventory**:
   - Batch: 10 parts waiting at each operation (potentially 50+ parts in process)
   - One-piece: 4-5 parts in process (one at each operation)

3. **Faster Quality Feedback**:
   - Batch: Make 10 bad parts before discovering error at next operation
   - One-piece: First bad part detected immediately, only 1 bad part made

4. **Less Space Required**:
   - No large queues between operations
   - Machines can be closer together

5. **Improved Cash Flow**:
   - Less inventory investment
   - Faster completion and invoicing

**Challenges:**

1. **Setup Time**: If setup time is long, batch production seems necessary
   - **Solution**: Reduce setup time (SMED - Single Minute Exchange of Die)
   - Goal: Setup under 10 minutes → one-piece flow practical

2. **Machine Reliability**: Breakdown stops entire flow
   - **Solution**: Preventive maintenance, spare capacity, quick response

3. **Balanced Cycle Times**: Operations must take similar time
   - **Solution**: Move work between operations to balance
   - Use simpler/faster machines if operation is too slow

4. **Cultural Change**: Operators accustomed to batching
   - **Solution**: Training, demonstration, involvement in design

**Practical Application:**

Pure one-piece flow isn't always practical, but **move toward it**:
- Reduce batch sizes progressively (10 → 5 → 2 → 1)
- Work on setup reduction
- Improve machine reliability
- Even small batches (2-5 pieces) capture most benefits

### 23.2.2.3 Machine Grouping Strategies

How should machines be organized?

**Strategy 1: Functional Layout (Process-Based)**

Group machines by type:
- All lathes together
- All mills together
- All grinders together

```
[Lathe Area]    [Milling Area]    [Grinding Area]
  L1  L2  L3      M1  M2  M3         G1  G2
```

**Advantages:**
- Similar machines together → easier supervision
- Shared tooling and fixturing
- Flexible for variety of part routings
- Efficient for very low volume (job shop)

**Disadvantages:**
- Long material travel (parts go to each area)
- High WIP (queues at each area)
- Complex scheduling
- Difficult to balance load
- Long lead times

**Best for:** Job shops with high variety, low volume, unpredictable demand

**Strategy 2: Cellular Layout (Product-Based)**

Group machines by product family:
- Cell A: Bracket parts (lathe, mill, drill, deburr)
- Cell B: Shaft parts (lathe, grind, inspection)
- Cell C: Housing parts (mill, tap, wash)

```
[Cell A]              [Cell B]              [Cell C]
L1→M1→D1→Deburr      L2→G1→Inspect        M2→Tap→Wash
```

**Advantages:**
- Short flow path
- Low WIP
- Fast throughput
- Easy scheduling (schedule cell, not individual machines)
- Cross-trained operators
- Team ownership

**Disadvantages:**
- May duplicate machines (can't share across cells)
- Less flexible for very different parts
- Requires volume to justify dedicated machines

**Best for:** Repetitive production, product families, moderate to high volume

**Strategy 3: Hybrid Layout**

Combine approaches:
- High-volume product families → dedicated cells
- Low-volume or specialized work → functional areas
- Shared expensive equipment → centralized (large 5-axis, CMM)

**Example:**
```
[Cell 1: High-Volume Brackets]
[Cell 2: High-Volume Shafts]
[Shared 5-Axis Area]
[Shared CMM Inspection]
[Job Shop Area: Low Volume]
```

**Best for:** Most real-world shops with mixed volumes and variety

**Decision Factors:**

| Factor | Functional Layout | Cellular Layout |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| Variety | High | Low-Moderate |
| Volume | Low | Moderate-High |
| Lead Time | Long | Short |
| WIP | High | Low |
| Flexibility | High | Moderate |
| Efficiency | Lower | Higher |
| Setup Time | Less Critical | Must be short |

## Summary

Facility layout is a foundational decision that affects efficiency, quality, safety, and scalability. Good layout minimizes transportation waste, creates smooth material flow, and enables visual management.

Key principles include:
- Unidirectional flow from receiving to shipping
- Machines grouped by product family (cellular layout) for efficiency
- U-shaped cells enabling one-piece flow
- Organized receiving, storage, and shipping areas
- Dedicated support areas (tool crib, inspection, maintenance)
- Safety built into layout (traffic separation, visibility, ergonomics)
- Design for future expansion and flexibility

Value Stream Mapping is a powerful tool for analyzing current layout and designing improvements. Even small layout changes can yield dramatic reductions in lead time and WIP.

In the next section, we'll explore 5S workplace organization, a methodology for maintaining an organized, efficient work environment within the layout we've designed.
