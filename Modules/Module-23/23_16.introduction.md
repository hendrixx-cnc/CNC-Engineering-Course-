# Module 23 – Shop Organization and Management


## Introduction

**Continuous Improvement (CI)**: The ongoing effort to improve products, services, and processes incrementally over time.

**Also Known As:**
- **Kaizen** (Japanese: "change for better")
- **Lean** (eliminate waste)
- **Operational Excellence**

**Why Continuous Improvement?**

**Static organizations decline:**
- Competition improves → you fall behind
- Complacency sets in → performance degrades
- Employee engagement drops → talent leaves

**Improving organizations thrive:**
- Stay competitive (match or beat competition)
- Engaged workforce (employees contribute ideas)
- Sustainable growth (build capabilities)

**CI Philosophy:**

**1. Everyone is Responsible**
- Not just management or engineers
- Every employee can identify and solve problems
- Small improvements add up to major impact

**2. Focus on Process, Not People**
- Bad outcomes usually result from bad processes
- Fix the process (don't blame people)
- Standardize good processes

**3. Incremental Progress**
- 1% improvement daily → 37× better in a year (compound effect)
- Many small improvements > few big projects
- Sustainable (vs. heroic one-time efforts)

**4. Data-Driven**
- Measure current state
- Test improvements
- Verify results

**This section covers:**
- Kaizen culture
- Improvement project management
- A3 problem solving
- Gemba walks
- Improvement tracking and celebration
- Building a learning organization

## 23.16.1 Kaizen Culture

**Kaizen Culture**: Organizational culture where continuous improvement is expected, normal, and celebrated.

### Characteristics of Kaizen Culture

**1. Problem Visibility**

**Traditional culture**: Hide problems (fear of blame)

**Kaizen culture**: Expose problems (opportunities to improve)

- Problems posted publicly (red tags, problem boards)
- Near-misses reported (learning opportunities)
- Celebrate finding problems (not hiding them)

**2. Everyone Improves**

**Traditional**: Improvement is management's job

**Kaizen**: Everyone responsible for improvement

- Operators suggest improvements
- Cross-functional teams solve problems
- Frontline employees empowered

**3. Rapid Experimentation**

**Traditional**: Analysis paralysis (study forever before acting)

**Kaizen**: Try it and see (rapid PDCA cycles)

- **Plan**: Hypothesis (will this work?)
- **Do**: Small-scale test
- **Check**: Measure results
- **Act**: Standardize if successful, revise if not

**4. Respect for People**

**Traditional**: Dictate solutions (top-down)

**Kaizen**: Involve those who do the work

- Respect their knowledge and ideas
- Collaborate on solutions
- Develop people (not just processes)

### Building Kaizen Culture

**Leadership Actions:**

**1. Model the Behavior**
- Leaders participate in improvement (not just delegate)
- Leaders go to gemba (see actual work)
- Leaders ask questions (not just give orders)

**2. Remove Barriers**
- Provide time for improvement (not "do it on your own time")
- Provide resources (tools, training)
- Eliminate bureaucracy (simple approval process)

**3. Recognize and Reward**
- Celebrate improvements (public recognition)
- Reward participation (not just results)
- Make heroes of improvers (not firefighters)

**4. Be Patient**
- Culture change takes years (not months)
- Reinforce consistently
- Don't revert to old ways under pressure

**Employee Actions:**

**1. Observe and Question**
- Look for waste (muda): waiting, excess motion, defects, etc.
- Ask "why?" (why do we do it this way?)
- Challenge assumptions

**2. Suggest Improvements**
- Submit ideas (formal suggestion system)
- Discuss with team and supervisor
- Start small (test ideas)

**3. Participate in Kaizen Events**
- Volunteer for improvement teams
- Contribute ideas and effort
- Learn new methods

**4. Sustain Improvements**
- Follow new standards
- Monitor results
- Suggest further refinement

### Obstacles to Kaizen Culture

**1. "We're Too Busy"**

Firefighting consumes all time → no time for improvement

**Reality**: Can't afford NOT to improve (inefficiency keeps you busy)

**Solution**: Allocate time (5% of labor hours to improvement)

**2. "Not Invented Here" Syndrome**

Reject outside ideas (pride, resistance)

**Solution**: Encourage learning (benchmarking, training, openness)

**3. Fear of Change**

Change is uncomfortable → resist

**Solution**: Involve people in designing change (ownership), start small (less threatening)

**4. Blame Culture**

Mistakes punished → hide problems, avoid risks

**Solution**: Shift to learning culture (mistakes are learning opportunities if we fix the root cause)

---

## 23.16.2 Improvement Project Management

**Improvement Projects**: Focused efforts to solve specific problems or improve processes.

### Types of Improvement Projects

**1. Kaizen Events** (Rapid Improvement Events)

**Characteristics:**
- **Focused**: One problem or process
- **Short**: 3-5 days (intensive)
- **Team-based**: Cross-functional team (5-8 people)
- **Action-oriented**: Implement changes during event (not just plan)

**Structure:**
- Day 1: Training, problem definition, current state analysis
- Day 2-3: Root cause analysis, brainstorm solutions, test ideas
- Day 4: Implement improvements
- Day 5: Standardize, train, present results

**Example**: Setup reduction kaizen
- Goal: Reduce setup time on Mill-3 from 60 min to 20 min
- Team: Operator, setup person, programmer, supervisor, engineer
- Results: Setup reduced to 22 min (63% improvement)

**2. Project Teams** (Longer Duration)

**Characteristics:**
- **Complex problem**: Requires deeper analysis or long-term effort
- **Duration**: Weeks to months
- **Part-time**: Team members have regular jobs (meet weekly)
- **Structured**: Project plan, milestones, timeline

**Example**: New fixture design
- Goal: Reduce cycle time and improve quality on Part 12345-A
- Duration: 8 weeks (design, build, test)
- Team: Engineer (lead), machinist, programmer, quality inspector

**3. Quick Wins** (Just Do It)

**Characteristics:**
- **Obvious solution**: Simple fix
- **Low cost**: < $500
- **Fast**: Implement immediately (don't wait for formal project)

**Example**: Add hook for air hose (stop tripping hazard)
- Cost: $5 hook
- Time: 10 minutes to install
- Benefit: Safety improvement, convenience

**Empowerment**: Authorize supervisors to approve quick wins (don't require lengthy approval)

### Project Selection and Prioritization

**Too many ideas, limited resources** → prioritize.

**Prioritization Criteria:**

**1. Impact**
- How much benefit? (cost savings, quality, safety, customer satisfaction)
- Quantify if possible ($10k/year savings, 50% scrap reduction)

**2. Effort**
- How much work? (hours, people, cost)
- Complexity?

**3. Strategic Alignment**
- Supports business goals? (OTD, OEE, new capabilities)
- Customer-driven?

**4. Feasibility**
- Technically possible?
- Resources available?

**Prioritization Matrix:**

```
High Impact
     │
  [Pursue]  │  [Major Projects]
            │  (High impact,
            │   high effort—
            │   plan carefully)
────────────┼────────────────────
            │
  [Quick Wins]  [Consider Later]
  (High impact, │ (Low impact,
   low effort—  │  high effort—
   do now!)     │  probably not)
            │
Low Impact  │
        Low Effort → High Effort
```

**Focus on:**
- **Quick Wins**: High impact, low effort (do immediately)
- **Pursue**: High impact, moderate effort (project teams)
- **Major Projects**: High impact, high effort (carefully planned, resourced)

### Project Tracking

**Track Progress:**

**1. Project Charter**
- Problem statement (what's wrong?)
- Goal (what success looks like—measurable)
- Team (members, roles)
- Timeline (start, milestones, completion)
- Resources (budget, equipment)

**2. Status Updates**
- Weekly or bi-weekly
- % complete
- Issues and risks
- On track or delayed?

**3. Results**
- Measure outcome (did we achieve goal?)
- Cost/benefit (savings vs. investment)
- Lessons learned (what worked, what didn't)

**Visual Tracking:**

**Improvement Board** (public display):
- Active projects (status, owners, timeline)
- Completed projects (results, savings)
- Ideas in queue (pending review)

(See Section 23.9.6 - Continuous Improvement Boards)

## 23.16.3 A3 Problem Solving

**A3**: Structured problem-solving method on one A3-size paper (11×17 inches).

**Origin**: Toyota (fit entire problem-solving story on one page)

**Philosophy**: Discipline thinking, clear communication, focus on root cause.

### A3 Format

**Left Side** (Understand the Problem):

**1. Background**
- Context (why is this important?)
- Problem statement (specific, measurable)

**2. Current State**
- What's happening now? (data, observations)
- Visual: diagram, chart, photo

**3. Goal / Target State**
- What should be happening? (measurable objective)
- Gap between current and target

**4. Root Cause Analysis**
- Why is the problem occurring? (5 Whys, fishbone)
- Data-driven analysis

**Right Side** (Solve the Problem):

**5. Countermeasures**
- Solutions to address root cause
- Specific actions (who, what, when)

**6. Implementation Plan**
- Timeline and milestones
- Resources needed
- Responsibilities

**7. Follow-Up / Results**
- Actual results (data, metrics)
- Did we achieve goal?
- Lessons learned, next steps

**A3 Example:**

```

## 23.16.4 Gemba Walks

**Gemba** (Japanese: "the real place"): Where value is created (shop floor, not office).

**Gemba Walk**: Leaders go to the shop floor to observe, ask questions, and learn.

**Purpose:**

**1. See Reality**
- Reports and metrics are abstractions
- Gemba shows what's really happening
- Build understanding of actual work

**2. Show Respect**
- Leaders care enough to come see
- Value employees' work
- Not remote or disconnected

**3. Identify Problems and Opportunities**
- Observe waste (waiting, excess motion, etc.)
- Ask questions (why do you do it that way?)
- Surface issues (employees share concerns)

**4. Coach and Develop**
- Teach problem-solving (in context)
- Reinforce standards
- Encourage improvement thinking

### How to Conduct a Gemba Walk

**1. Plan** (but be flexible)
- **Focus**: What to observe? (safety, quality, flow, specific process)
- **Route**: Which areas to visit
- **Frequency**: Daily (supervisors), weekly (managers), monthly (executives)

**2. Observe First**
- Watch work being done
- Don't interrupt unnecessarily
- Look for:
  - Safety issues
  - Quality problems
  - Waste (waiting, searching, excess motion)
  - Standard work compliance
  - 5S condition

**3. Ask Questions** (not interrogate)
- **Open-ended**: "How is this process going?" "What challenges do you face?"
- **Why**: "Why do you do it this way?" (understand, not criticize)
- **Ideas**: "Do you have suggestions to improve this?"
- **Listen**: Don't immediately offer solutions (let people think)

**4. Take Notes**
- Observations (problems, opportunities)
- Ideas suggested (by employees or your own)
- Follow-up items (assign owner, due date)

**5. Follow Up**
- Address issues found (quickly)
- Implement suggestions (or explain why not)
- Report back (close the loop with employees)

**6. Thank People**
- Appreciate their work
- Recognize good practices
- Encourage continued improvement

### Gemba Walk Don'ts

**1. Don't Manage by Walking Around (MBWA)**

Gemba walk ≠ simply walking around chatting

**MBWA**: Informal, social
**Gemba Walk**: Structured, purposeful (observe, learn, improve)

**2. Don't Fault-Find**

Not an inspection (looking for violations to punish)

**Purpose**: Learn and improve (supportive, not punitive)

**3. Don't Solve Problems on the Spot**

Resist urge to immediately fix everything

**Better**: Ask questions, guide thinking, let people develop solutions (build capability)

**Exception**: Safety issues (address immediately)

**4. Don't Interrupt Work Unnecessarily**

Be respectful of operators' time and focus

**5. Don't Skip Follow-Up**

Gemba walk without follow-up = waste of time (no action, erodes trust)

### Gemba Walk Example

**Manager Gemba Walk - Mill-3:**

**Observations:**
- Operator searches for hex key (3 minutes) → **Issue**: Tools not in shadow board
- Coolant level low, operator tops off → **Positive**: Autonomous maintenance
- Part in queue (waiting for inspection) → **Issue**: Bottleneck at inspection?

**Questions Asked:**
- "How often do you have to search for tools?" → Answer: "Daily, they get borrowed"
- "Is the coolant level alarm working?" → Answer: "Yes, but I check visually too"
- "How long do parts typically wait for inspection?" → Answer: "Varies, 1-4 hours"

**Follow-Up Actions:**
- Tool shadow board discipline: Supervisor to reinforce (tools returned immediately)
- Inspection bottleneck: Review workload, consider cross-training operator to do basic inspection
- Recognize: Operator doing great job with autonomous maintenance (public thank you)

## 23.16.5 Improvement Tracking and Celebration

**Track Improvements**: Document what's been improved and results achieved.

**Why Track?**

**1. Accountability**
- Ensure projects complete (not forgotten)
- Verify results (did we achieve goal?)

**2. Visibility**
- Show progress (momentum builds)
- Communicate wins (to organization and customers)

**3. Learning**
- What worked? (repeat)
- What didn't? (avoid)
- Build knowledge base

**4. Motivation**
- Celebrate success (reinforce behavior)
- Encourage more improvement

### Improvement Log

**Master list** of all improvements:

| ID | Date | Title | Problem | Solution | Owner | Status | Savings |
|----|------|-------|---------|----------|-------|--------|---------|
| 2025-01 | 1/5 | Setup reduction Mill-3 | Setup 60 min | SMED, quick-change jaws | Jane | Complete | $12k/yr |
| 2025-02 | 1/12 | Tool cart redesign | Searching for tools | Reorganized cart, labels | Mike | Complete | $2k/yr |
| 2025-03 | 1/20 | Coolant system | High bacteria, smell | New biocide, clean schedule | Sarah | In Progress | TBD |

**Track:**
- Problem and solution (what was improved)
- Owner (who led)
- Status (complete, in progress, planned)
- Results (quantified: time, cost, quality)

### Celebrating Improvements

**Celebration = Recognition = Reinforcement**

**Methods:**

**1. Public Recognition**
- **Stand-up meetings**: Shout-out for completed improvement
- **Improvement board**: "Improvement of the Month" featured
- **Company meetings**: Present significant improvements to entire company
- **Newsletter**: Article highlighting team and results

**2. Awards and Rewards**
- **Certificate**: Formal recognition (frame-worthy)
- **Monetary reward**: % of savings, flat amount (e.g., $100 gift card)
- **Trophy or plaque**: Physical symbol (displayed at workstation)
- **Lunch with leadership**: Owner(s) and manager have lunch (relationship building)

**3. Photo and Story**
- **Before/After photos**: Visual impact (powerful)
- **Story**: Brief narrative (problem, solution, results)
- **Posted**: Improvement board, breakroom, intranet

**4. Peer Recognition**
- **Nomination**: Employees nominate peers for recognition
- **Voting**: Team votes on "Best Improvement"

**Celebration Principles:**

- **Timely**: Recognize soon after completion (not months later)
- **Specific**: "Great job reducing setup time 63%" (not just "good work")
- **Public**: Others see and are inspired
- **Sincere**: Genuine appreciation (not hollow ritual)
- **Inclusive**: Recognize everyone on team (not just leader)

## 23.16.6 Building a Learning Organization

**Learning Organization**: Organization that continuously learns and adapts.

**Characteristics:**

**1. Systems Thinking**
- Understand interdependencies (changing one area affects others)
- Optimize the whole (not just individual parts)

**2. Personal Mastery**
- Individuals committed to learning and growth
- Continuous skill development
- Openness to feedback

**3. Mental Models**
- Challenge assumptions (why do we believe that?)
- Openness to new ideas
- Unlearn old ways when needed

**4. Shared Vision**
- Common purpose (everyone understands "why")
- Aligned goals (individual goals support organizational goals)

**5. Team Learning**
- Collaborate and share knowledge
- Cross-functional teams
- Learn from each other

### Building a Learning Organization

**1. Invest in Training**

**Types:**
- **Technical skills**: CNC programming, setup, inspection
- **Problem-solving**: 5 Whys, A3, statistical methods
- **Leadership**: Supervisory skills, coaching, communication
- **Safety**: OSHA, hazmat, ergonomics

**Budget**: 2-5% of labor cost for training

**2. Encourage Experimentation**

- **Safe to fail**: Small experiments won't sink the company
- **Learn from failure**: Post-mortem (what happened, what learned)
- **Celebrate learning**: Not just success (also intelligent failures)

**3. Share Knowledge**

**Methods:**
- **Documentation**: Lessons learned, best practices (wiki, intranet)
- **Meetings**: Share improvements across teams
- **Cross-training**: Job rotation, shadowing
- **Mentoring**: Experienced employees teach new employees

**4. Benchmark and Learn from Others**

- **Industry conferences**: Attend, learn, bring back ideas
- **Facility tours**: Visit other manufacturers (even different industries)
- **Trade publications**: Read, stay current with trends
- **Suppliers and customers**: Learn from their expertise

**5. Measure Learning**

**Metrics:**
- Training hours per employee per year
- Skill certifications earned
- Cross-training matrix (breadth of skills)
- Improvement suggestions per employee

**Target**: 20-40 training hours per employee per year

**6. Leadership Development**

- **Succession planning**: Develop internal talent (not always hire externally)
- **Coaching**: Managers coach employees (not just direct)
- **Leadership training**: Formal programs for emerging leaders

### Learning from Problems

**Problems are learning opportunities** (not just fires to extinguish).

**After Problem Solved:**

**1. Root Cause Documentation**
- What was the root cause? (not symptom)
- Why did it happen? (5 Whys, fishbone)

**2. Countermeasure**
- What did we change? (specific action)
- Why does it prevent recurrence?

**3. Standardization**
- Update procedures, work instructions
- Train affected employees

**4. Horizontal Deployment**
- Could this problem occur elsewhere? (other machines, parts, processes)
- Apply countermeasure proactively

**5. Share Learning**
- Document (A3, case study)
- Present to organization (lessons learned)
- Add to knowledge base

**Example:**

**Problem**: Drill broke in Part 12345-A, scrapping part
**Root Cause**: Pecking depth too aggressive (chips packed, drill overheated)
**Countermeasure**: Reduce pecking depth from 2× diameter to 1× diameter
**Standardize**: Update all programs with deep holes (not just this part)
**Share**: Present at team meeting, update programming guidelines

## Summary

Continuous improvement infrastructure builds the systems, culture, and capabilities for ongoing improvement. Key elements include:

- **Kaizen culture**: Everyone responsible for improvement, problems visible, rapid experimentation
- **Improvement projects**: Kaizen events, project teams, quick wins—structured and prioritized
- **A3 problem solving**: Disciplined thinking on one page—understand problem, address root cause
- **Gemba walks**: Leaders go to shop floor to observe, ask questions, learn, and support
- **Tracking and celebration**: Document improvements, recognize contributors, reinforce behavior
- **Learning organization**: Invest in training, share knowledge, learn from problems

Continuous improvement is not a program—it's a way of working. It requires leadership commitment, employee engagement, structured methods, and sustained effort. The result is a competitive, adaptive organization that continuously raises the bar.

In the final section, we'll explore practical implementation—how to start and sustain shop organization and improvement efforts.
