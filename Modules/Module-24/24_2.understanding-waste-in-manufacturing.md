# Module 24 – L.E.A.N. Strategies for CNC Manufacturing


## 24.2.1 Understanding Waste in Manufacturing

In Lean thinking, **waste** (or **muda** in Japanese) is defined as any activity that consumes resources (time, material, labor, equipment) but does not create value for the customer.

### The Value Question

**Would the customer pay for this activity?**

- **YES** → Value-added activity (keep and optimize)
- **NO** → Non-value-added activity (waste—eliminate if possible)

### Three Categories of Activities

**Type 1: Value-Added (VA)**
- Transforms the product in a way customers value
- Customer willing to pay for it
- Examples: Cutting metal, drilling holes, welding

**Type 2: Non-Value-Added but Necessary (NVAN)**
- Doesn't add customer value but required (for now)
- Due to current technology, regulations, or methods
- Examples: Inspections, setups, some material handling
- **Goal**: Minimize these activities

**Type 3: Pure Waste (NVA)**
- Adds no value and not necessary
- Examples: Waiting, searching for tools, rework, excess inventory
- **Goal**: Eliminate completely

### The Waste Iceberg

Most companies only see obvious wastes (scrap, rework, downtime). These are like the tip of an iceberg—visible above water.

**Above Water (Visible ~20%):**
- Scrap and rework
- Machine breakdowns
- Customer complaints
- Obvious defects

**Below Water (Hidden ~80%):**
- Waiting time
- Excess inventory
- Unnecessary motion
- Overproduction
- Transportation
- Extra processing
- Underutilized talent

**Lean makes the invisible waste visible.**

## 24.2.2 Defects (D)

**Definition:** Production of non-conforming parts or products requiring rework or scrap.

### 24.2.2.1 Cost of Scrap and Rework

Defects are expensive, and the cost multiplies as they move downstream.

**The 1-10-100 Rule:**
- Defect caught at the operation: **$1** to fix
- Defect caught at final inspection: **$10** to fix
- Defect reaches customer: **$100** to fix (plus reputation damage)

**Real Costs of Defects:**

**Material Costs:**
- Raw material wasted
- Consumables used (tooling, coolant, etc.)

**Labor Costs:**
- Operator time on defective work
- Inspector time finding defect
- Rework labor (if salvageable)
- Engineering time investigating

**Equipment Costs:**
- Machine time wasted
- Capacity lost to rework
- Setup time for rework

**Indirect Costs:**
- Delayed shipments
- Expediting costs
- Lost customer confidence
- Warranty claims
- Sales team time placating customers

**Hidden Costs:**
- Future business lost
- Employee morale impact
- Management attention diverted

### Example: CNC Scrap Part

**Scenario:** Aluminum part, 4 hours machining, discovered defective at final inspection

**Direct Costs:**
- Material: $85
- Machine time: 4 hrs × $75/hr = $300
- Operator labor: 4 hrs × $35/hr = $140
- Tooling consumed: $25
- **Subtotal: $550**

**Indirect Costs:**
- Inspector time: 0.5 hr × $40/hr = $20
- Engineering investigation: 2 hrs × $85/hr = $170
- Supervisor time: 1 hr × $60/hr = $60
- Remake setup: 1 hr × $75/hr = $75
- **Subtotal: $325**

**Total Cost: $875** (for one defective part!)

**If 100 defects/year at this cost: $87,500 annual impact**

### 24.2.2.2 Root Causes of Defects

Understanding root causes is essential to prevention.

**Process-Related Causes:**
- Inadequate process capability (Cpk < 1.33)
- Process variation (temperature, pressure, etc.)
- Tool wear not monitored
- Inconsistent methods (no standard work)
- Poor process design

**Equipment-Related Causes:**
- Machine out of calibration
- Worn or damaged equipment
- Inadequate maintenance
- Equipment not capable for tolerance required

**Material-Related Causes:**
- Material variation (hardness, composition)
- Incorrect material used
- Damaged material not detected
- Poor supplier quality

**Method-Related Causes:**
- Unclear work instructions
- No standard work
- Outdated procedures
- Missing critical steps

**People-Related Causes:**
- Inadequate training
- Fatigue or distraction
- Lack of understanding requirements
- No feedback on quality

**Measurement-Related Causes:**
- Gage not calibrated
- Wrong inspection method
- Measurement error
- Unclear specifications

**Management-Related Causes:**
- Pressure to ship over quality
- Inadequate resources for quality
- No time allowed for problem-solving
- Quality not valued in culture

### 24.2.2.3 Prevention Strategies

**1. Design for Manufacturability**
- Eliminate tight tolerances where not needed
- Design for standard processes
- Reduce complexity

**2. Mistake-Proofing (Poka-Yoke)**
- Fixtures prevent incorrect loading
- Sensors detect missing operations
- Automated checks verify critical dimensions
- *Covered in detail in Section 24.9*

**3. Standard Work**
- Document best method
- Train everyone to same standard
- Make deviations visible
- *Covered in Section 24.12*

**4. Process Control**
- Monitor critical parameters
- Statistical Process Control (SPC)
- Automatic adjustments where possible
- Alarms for out-of-spec conditions

**5. First-Off Inspection**
- Verify first piece after setup
- Dimensional check before running quantity
- Prevents batch defects

**6. In-Process Inspection**
- Frequent checks during run
- Self-inspection by operator
- Catch drift before many defects

**7. Problem-Solving Culture**
- Stop and fix problems when found
- Root cause analysis (5 Whys, fishbone)
- Countermeasures implemented
- Follow-up to verify effectiveness

**8. Supplier Quality**
- Certified suppliers
- Incoming inspection
- Partnership approach
- Shared quality standards

## Summary

The eight wastes (DOWNTIME) consume resources without adding customer value. Section 24.2 covers defects, overproduction, waiting, non-utilized talent, transportation, inventory, motion, and extra processing. Understanding and eliminating these wastes is fundamental to Lean manufacturing success.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Waste (muda)** is any activity consuming resources without creating customer value
2. **DOWNTIME** acronym represents the eight wastes
3. **The 1-10-100 rule** shows defect costs multiply downstream
4. **Three activity types**: Value-added, non-value-added but necessary, pure waste
5. **Most waste is hidden** like an iceberg below the waterline
