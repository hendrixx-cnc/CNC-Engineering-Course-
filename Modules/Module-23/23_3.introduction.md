# Module 23 – Shop Organization and Management


## Introduction

5S is a systematic methodology for workplace organization that creates and maintains a clean, organized, efficient, and safe work environment. Originating from Japanese manufacturing (Toyota Production System), 5S is now practiced worldwide across all industries.

The five S's are:
1. **Sort** (Seiri) – Eliminate unnecessary items
2. **Set in Order** (Seiton) – Organize and label
3. **Shine** (Seiso) – Clean and inspect
4. **Standardize** (Seiketsu) – Create standards
5. **Sustain** (Shitsuke) – Maintain and improve

5S is not "just housekeeping." It's a discipline that:
- Eliminates waste
- Improves efficiency
- Enhances safety
- Builds quality awareness
- Creates visual management
- Establishes foundation for continuous improvement

## 23.3.1 The 5S Methodology

### 23.3.1.1 Sort (Seiri) – Eliminate Unnecessary Items

**Purpose**: Remove everything not needed for current operations

**Why Sort?**

Unnecessary items cause:
- **Clutter**: Hard to find what you need
- **Wasted space**: Valuable floor/bench space consumed
- **Confusion**: Which tools/materials are current?
- **Safety hazards**: Tripping, falling objects
- **Wasted time**: Searching through clutter

**What to Sort:**

Everything in the work area:
- Tools and equipment
- Gages and instruments
- Fixtures and jigs
- Materials and supplies
- Documents and prints
- Furniture and storage
- Scrap and waste

**Sorting Criteria:**

For each item, ask:
1. **Is it needed?** Does this work area require it?
2. **How often is it used?**
   - Constantly (multiple times per day)
   - Regularly (daily or weekly)
   - Occasionally (monthly or less)
   - Rarely or never

3. **How much is needed?** Often we have far more than necessary

**Sorting Decisions:**

| Frequency | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Constantly | Keep at work area, immediately accessible |
| Regularly | Keep at work area, organized storage |
| Occasionally | Keep nearby (tool crib, storage) |
| Rarely | Move to central storage or remove entirely |
| Never | Dispose, recycle, or return to owner |

**Red Tag Strategy** (covered in 23.3.3): Formal process for sorting

**Common Unnecessary Items in CNC Shops:**

- Obsolete tooling for parts no longer made
- Broken equipment waiting for repair
- Excessive inventory of consumables
- Old paperwork and prints (superseded revisions)
- Personal items mixed with work items
- "Someday might use" items
- Duplicate tools

**Benefits of Sorting:**

- Free up space (often 20-30% more usable area)
- Easier to find what you need
- Reduced search time
- Safer work environment
- Clear what belongs vs. doesn't belong

### 23.3.1.2 Set in Order (Seiton) – Organize and Label

**Purpose**: A place for everything, and everything in its place

**Why Set in Order?**

After sorting, we have only necessary items—now organize them for efficiency.

**Principles:**

1. **Frequency of Use**: Most-used items most accessible
2. **Point of Use**: Store where used, not in central location
3. **Visual**: See at a glance what's available and where it goes
4. **Easy Access**: Retrieve and return with minimal effort
5. **Safety**: Store hazardous items appropriately

**Organization Methods:**

**1. Shadow Boards**

Outline of each tool on pegboard or panel:
- Tool shape painted or cut out
- Tool hangs in its specific location
- Empty shadow instantly visible (missing tool obvious)

Best for:
- Hand tools (wrenches, hammers, pliers)
- Inspection gages (micrometers, calipers)
- Safety equipment (PPE, first aid)

**2. Labeled Storage**

Bins, drawers, shelves clearly labeled:
- What belongs there
- Quantity (if applicable)
- Size, type, or specification

Best for:
- Cutting tools (endmills, drills by size)
- Fasteners and hardware
- Consumables (gloves, rags, coolant)

**3. Color Coding**

Visual system using colors:
- Material types (aluminum = blue, steel = red, stainless = green)
- Tool types (insert colors match tool holder colors)
- Area designation (this cart belongs in Cell 3 = yellow)

**4. Location Addresses**

Assign location codes like a library:
- Aisle-Bay-Shelf-Bin: A3-B2-S4-Bin5
- Useful for larger shops, inventory systems

**5. First-In-First-Out (FIFO)**

Organize so oldest items used first:
- Gravity flow racks (new in back, slides to front)
- Date labels (use oldest first)
- Prevents expiration or obsolescence

**Organization Guidelines:**

**At Machines:**
- Tools for current job within arm's reach
- Common tools (hex keys, wrenches) in shadow board near machine
- Inspection tools at point of use
- Work instructions visible (eye level, protected from coolant)

**Tool Crib:**
- Group by type (endmills, drills, inserts, holders)
- Sub-sort by size (within each type)
- Clear labels with size/specification
- Most-used items at waist height, easy reach

**Material Storage:**
- Group by material type and size
- Clearly labeled with material specification
- Organized for FIFO
- Heavy materials low (safety), light materials can be higher

**Workbenches:**
- Frequently-used tools in top drawers or pegboard
- Less-frequent tools in lower drawers or cabinets
- Measuring tools protected (cases or organized drawers)

**Benefits of Set in Order:**

- No searching—everything has a home
- Visual: immediately see if something is missing
- Faster retrieval and return
- Inventory management (easy to see what's low)
- Easier for new employees (self-explanatory)

### 23.3.1.3 Shine (Seiso) – Clean and Inspect

**Purpose**: Clean everything thoroughly and keep it that way

**Why Shine?**

Cleaning is not just aesthetics—it's **inspection and maintenance**.

**Benefits of Shine:**

1. **Inspection**: Cleaning reveals problems
   - Coolant leaks
   - Oil leaks
   - Loose bolts or nuts
   - Worn components
   - Cracks or damage
   - Chip buildup in areas it shouldn't be

2. **Maintenance**: Regular cleaning is preventive maintenance
   - Prevents chip buildup in ways
   - Keeps coolant systems clear
   - Reduces corrosion
   - Extends equipment life

3. **Safety**: Clean floor prevents slips and trips
   - Chip piles are hazards
   - Oil spills are dangerous
   - Clear walkways prevent accidents

4. **Quality**: Clean environment improves quality
   - Chips don't contaminate parts
   - Clean measurement surfaces
   - Professional appearance

5. **Pride**: Clean workplace boosts morale
   - Pleasant to work in
   - Reflects professionalism
   - People take pride in clean environment

**What to Clean:**

**Machines:**
- Wipe down exterior surfaces
- Clean chip build-up
- Clean coolant trays and filters
- Clean windows and doors
- Vacuum or blow out control panels (carefully)

**Workstations:**
- Wipe benches and surfaces
- Organize tools (return to shadow boards)
- Empty trash and chip bins
- Clean floors around station

**Common Areas:**
- Sweep and mop floors
- Clean restrooms and break areas
- Organize storage areas
- Keep aisles clear

**Equipment:**
- Clean inspection gages after use
- Wipe down material handling equipment
- Clean vises, fixtures, and tooling
- Maintain air tools (lubricate, clean filters)

**Cleaning Standards:**

Establish how clean is "clean enough":
- **Daily cleaning**: End of shift, machine and workstation
- **Weekly cleaning**: Deep clean, less-accessible areas
- **Monthly cleaning**: Overhead, behind machines, storage areas

**Assign Responsibility:**
- Each operator responsible for their machine/area
- Shared areas assigned on rotation
- Supervision verifies standards are met

**Inspection During Cleaning:**

Train employees to look for problems while cleaning:
- Leaks (oil, coolant, air)
- Unusual noises or vibration
- Worn or damaged components
- Loose fasteners
- Anything abnormal

**Report problems immediately** using maintenance request or tagging system.

### 23.3.1.4 Standardize (Seiketsu) – Create Standards

**Purpose**: Make the first three S's routine and consistent

**Why Standardize?**

Without standards:
- Each person does it differently
- Quality and consistency vary
- Improvements don't stick
- Backsliding occurs

**Standardization ensures:**
- Everyone follows the same methods
- Work is done the right way, every time
- New employees learn correct methods
- Improvements are captured and sustained

**What to Standardize:**

**1. Sorting Standards**: What stays, what goes
- Document criteria for what belongs in each area
- Red tag procedures for questionable items

**2. Organization Standards**: Where things go
- Labels and signs
- Shadow boards
- Color coding
- Storage locations documented (photos or diagrams)

**3. Cleaning Standards**: What, when, how
- Cleaning checklists for each area
- Frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Responsibility assignments
- Supplies and equipment needed

**4. Visual Standards**: How things should look
- "Before" photos (what not to do)
- "After" photos (what good looks like)
- Posted at work area as reference

**Standard Work for 5S:**

Create **5S checklists** for each area:

**Example: CNC Lathe Daily 5S Checklist**
- [ ] Sort: Remove unnecessary items from machine area
- [ ] Set in Order: Return all tools to shadow board
- [ ] Set in Order: Organize work surface
- [ ] Shine: Wipe down machine exterior
- [ ] Shine: Clean chip conveyor and coolant tank
- [ ] Shine: Sweep floor around machine
- [ ] Shine: Inspect for leaks or damage (report if found)
- [ ] Check: Verify all items complete

**Documentation:**

- **5S Map**: Diagram of area showing organization
- **Shadow board photos**: Reference for tool placement
- **Cleaning procedures**: Step-by-step for specific tasks
- **Responsibility matrix**: Who does what, when

**Visual Management:**

Standards should be **self-explanatory**:
- Shadow boards (tool shape shows where it goes)
- Floor markings (yellow lines = aisles, red = fire equipment)
- Color coding (material types, area assignments)
- Signs and labels (clear, pictorial when possible)

A visitor should understand the organization without explanation.

### 23.3.1.5 Sustain (Shitsuke) – Maintain and Improve

**Purpose**: Make 5S a habit, not a one-time event

**Why Sustain is Hardest:**

Initial 5S is exciting—visible transformation, quick results. But sustaining is challenging:
- Daily pressures ("too busy to clean")
- Old habits return
- Standards slowly degrade
- Management attention shifts elsewhere

**Without Sustain, 5S fails.** Within months, workplace reverts to pre-5S chaos.

**Sustaining Strategies:**

**1. Leadership Commitment**

- Management visibly practices 5S (own areas)
- Management regularly tours shop floor, observes 5S
- 5S is a priority, not "when there's time"
- Resources provided (time, supplies)

**2. Training and Onboarding**

- All employees trained in 5S principles
- New hires receive 5S training
- Refresher training periodically
- 5S included in job descriptions

**3. Daily Discipline**

- 5S checklists completed daily
- Operators responsible for their areas
- Time allocated (last 10 minutes of shift)
- Expectation: area left clean and organized

**4. Audits and Accountability**

- Regular 5S audits (weekly or monthly)
- Scorecard to track performance
- Results posted publicly
- Areas with low scores get support (not just blame)

**5. Recognition and Rewards**

- Celebrate improvements
- Recognize individuals or teams with excellent 5S
- Friendly competition between areas
- Before/after photos to show progress

**6. Continuous Improvement**

- 5S is never "done"—always improving
- Encourage suggestions for better organization
- Implement improvements quickly
- Make it easy to maintain standards

**Common Pitfalls:**

- **One-time event**: "We did 5S last year" (it's continuous!)
- **Management inconsistency**: Standards not uniformly enforced
- **No time allocated**: Expecting 5S on top of full production load
- **Blaming culture**: Punishing low scores instead of supporting improvement
- **Complexity**: Overly elaborate systems that are hard to maintain

**Sustain Checklist:**

- [ ] Leadership demonstrates commitment
- [ ] All employees trained
- [ ] Time allocated for 5S activities
- [ ] Checklists and standards documented
- [ ] Regular audits conducted
- [ ] Results tracked and posted
- [ ] Improvements recognized and celebrated
- [ ] Non-compliance addressed constructively

---

## 23.3.3 Red Tag Strategy for Sorting

**Purpose**: Systematic method for identifying and removing unnecessary items

**Process:**

1. **Establish Red Tag Area**: Designated location for questionable items
   - Clearly marked
   - Temporary holding area

2. **Red Tag Event**: Sort through work area
   - Tag everything that is:
     - Not needed
     - Not sure if needed
     - Broken or obsolete
     - Excessive quantity
   - Tag has:
     - Item description
     - Location found
     - Date tagged
     - Why tagged (broken, obsolete, excess, unknown)
     - Tagger's name

3. **Move to Red Tag Area**: Tagged items go to holding area
   - Keeps them out of work area
   - Gives time to decide disposition

4. **Review Period**: 30 days (or defined period)
   - If someone needs the item, they retrieve it (untagged, returns to use)
   - If no one claims, likely not needed

5. **Disposition**: After review period
   - **Dispose**: Trash or recycle
   - **Sell**: Surplus or scrap value
   - **Return**: To supplier, customer, or another department
   - **Repair**: Fix and return to service
   - **Archive**: Long-term storage (rarely needed but must keep)

**Red Tag Benefits:**

- **Safe**: Doesn't immediately throw away (can retrieve if needed)
- **Visible**: Large accumulation of red tags shows extent of clutter
- **Decisive**: After 30 days, dispose (don't keep endlessly)
- **Data**: Track what's being removed and why (identify trends)

**Red Tag Targets:**

- Old tooling and fixtures
- Obsolete inventory
- Broken equipment waiting for repair
- Excessive spare parts
- Outdated documents
- "Someday might use" items
- Unknown items (no one knows what it's for)

---

## 23.3.4 Shadow Boards and Visual Management

**Shadow Boards** are a cornerstone of 5S visual management.

**Design Principles:**

1. **Tool Outline**: Shape of tool painted or cut out
   - Tool shape immediately visible
   - Empty shadow shows missing tool

2. **High Contrast**: Shadow different color than background
   - Easy to see from distance
   - Common: Yellow background, black shadow or red background, white outline

3. **Labeled**: Tool name or size next to shadow
   - Helpful for new employees
   - Prevents putting wrong tool in wrong spot

4. **Organized Layout**: Logical arrangement
   - By size (small to large)
   - By frequency of use (most-used in center, easy reach)
   - By type (wrenches together, pliers together)

**Creating Shadow Boards:**

**Materials:**
- Pegboard, plywood, or foam board
- Paint or markers
- Hooks or holders for tools
- Labels (stenciled or printed)

**Method 1: Paint**
1. Arrange tools on board
2. Trace outline of each tool
3. Paint inside outline (contrasting color)
4. Attach hooks or holders
5. Label each tool

**Method 2: Foam (Kaizen Foam)**
1. Two-layer foam (top color, bottom contrasting color)
2. Trace tool outline
3. Cut out top layer (tool sits in cutout)
4. Bottom layer shows as contrasting shadow
5. Tool nestles in foam (secure, protected)

**Locations for Shadow Boards:**

- **Machine tools**: Common tools (hex keys, wrenches) near machine
- **Tool crib**: Gages, inspection tools, hand tools
- **Maintenance shop**: Maintenance tools and equipment
- **Shipping area**: Packaging tools (tape guns, staplers)
- **Safety equipment**: First aid kit contents, PPE

**Visual Management Beyond Shadow Boards:**

**Floor Marking:**
- Yellow lines: Aisles and traffic lanes
- Red lines: Safety zones (fire equipment, electrical panels)
- Blue lines: Work area boundaries
- White lines: Storage locations (outline where cart or pallet goes)

**Color Coding:**
- Materials (aluminum, steel, stainless)
- Tools (different insert colors for different tool holders)
- Status (green = good, red = problem, yellow = caution)
- Areas (Cell 1 = blue, Cell 2 = green, etc.)

**Signs and Labels:**
- Location labels (where things go)
- Content labels (what's inside)
- Instruction signs (how to do something)
- Warning signs (safety hazards)

**Visual Controls:**
- Min/Max lines on bins (visual trigger to reorder)
- Andon lights (green = running, yellow = attention, red = down)
- Kanban cards (visual signal to replenish)
- Status boards (schedule, metrics, problems)

**Benefits of Visual Management:**

- **Self-explanatory**: New employees understand without extensive training
- **Instant feedback**: See at a glance if something is wrong
- **Discipline**: Harder to violate standards when they're visible
- **Efficiency**: Less time searching and asking questions

---

## 23.3.5 5S Audits and Scorecards

**Purpose**: Verify 5S standards are maintained and identify improvement opportunities

**Audit Process:**

1. **Frequency**: Weekly or monthly (depending on maturity)

2. **Auditors**:
   - Supervisor or manager
   - Peer audits (Cell A audits Cell B)
   - External (quality manager, consultant)

3. **Scorecard**: Standardized checklist
   - Objective criteria
   - Scoring system (1-5 or pass/fail)

4. **Walk the Area**: Observe and score
   - Compare to standards (photos, checklists)
   - Look for deviations

5. **Document**: Record scores and observations
   - Note strengths and issues
   - Take photos if needed

6. **Feedback**: Share results
   - Post scores publicly
   - Discuss with team
   - Non-punitive (focus on improvement)

7. **Action**: Address issues
   - Low scores → improvement plan
   - Provide support (training, resources)

**Example 5S Scorecard:**

**Area: CNC Lathe #3** | Date: _____ | Auditor: _____

| Criterion | 1 (Poor) | 2 | 3 (Avg) | 4 | 5 (Excellent) | Score |
|-----------|----------|---|---------|---|---------------|-------|
| **Sort**: Unnecessary items removed | Many unneeded items | Some unneeded | Only needed items | Well sorted | Excellent sort | ____ |
| **Set in Order**: Everything has place | No organization | Partial organization | Mostly organized | Well organized | Perfect organization | ____ |
| **Set in Order**: Labels clear and accurate | No labels | Some labels | Most labeled | Clear labels | Excellent labels | ____ |
| **Shine**: Machine clean | Dirty, chips, spills | Needs cleaning | Acceptable | Clean | Very clean | ____ |
| **Shine**: Floor clean and clear | Cluttered, dirty | Needs attention | Acceptable | Clean, clear | Spotless | ____ |
| **Standardize**: Standards posted and followed | No standards | Standards not followed | Partial compliance | Good compliance | Excellent compliance | ____ |
| **Sustain**: Consistent over time | Inconsistent | Declining | Stable | Improving | Excellent sustained | ____ |

**Total Score: ____ / 35** (or ____ %)

**Comments / Action Items:**

**Alternative Scoring:**

**Pass/Fail Checklist**: Each item is Yes or No
- Simpler, faster
- Less granularity
- Good for basic compliance

**Weighted Scoring**: Some criteria worth more points
- Emphasize priorities (e.g., Safety = 2× points)
- Reflects importance

**Scoring Levels:**

- **90-100%**: Excellent (Green)
- **75-89%**: Good (Yellow)
- **Below 75%**: Needs Improvement (Red)

**Use Results:**

- **Trending**: Track scores over time (improving or declining?)
- **Comparison**: Which areas are best? Learn from them.
- **Recognition**: Celebrate high scores
- **Support**: Low scores get resources and attention
- **Accountability**: Persistent low scores require action

## 23.3.6 Sustaining 5S Long-Term

**Making 5S Permanent:**

### Leadership and Culture

1. **Walk the Talk**: Leaders practice 5S in own areas
2. **Regular Gemba Walks**: Leaders tour floor, observe 5S
3. **Communicate Importance**: 5S is not optional
4. **Provide Resources**: Time, supplies, training

### Systems and Processes

5. **Integrate with Daily Work**: 5S is part of every job
6. **Allocate Time**: End-of-shift cleanup, not overtime
7. **Audits and Metrics**: Regular measurement and tracking
8. **Continuous Improvement**: Make it easier to maintain standards

### People and Engagement

9. **Training**: All employees understand why and how
10. **Ownership**: Employees responsible for their areas
11. **Suggestions**: Employees propose improvements
12. **Recognition**: Celebrate successes

### Problem-Solving

13. **Root Cause**: Why did standards slip? Fix the cause.
14. **Non-Punitive**: Support, not blame
15. **Quick Response**: Address issues immediately

### Long-Term Mindset

16. **Patience**: Culture change takes years
17. **Persistence**: Don't give up when enthusiasm wanes
18. **Adaptation**: Evolve 5S as business changes
19. **Never Done**: 5S is a journey, not a destination

**Common Challenges and Solutions:**

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| "Too busy to clean" | Schedule time, make it non-negotiable |
| Old habits return | Frequent audits, immediate feedback |
| Management stops paying attention | Make 5S part of management routine (gemba walks) |
| New employees don't know standards | Include 5S in onboarding training |
| Standards slip over time | Regular audits, refresh training |
| Complexity overwhelming | Start simple, build gradually |
| No accountability | Link 5S to performance reviews |
| "We tried that before" (cynicism) | Leadership commitment, visible improvement |

## Summary

5S is a powerful methodology for creating and maintaining an organized, efficient workplace. The five steps—Sort, Set in Order, Shine, Standardize, Sustain—build progressively:

1. **Sort** eliminates unnecessary items
2. **Set in Order** organizes what remains
3. **Shine** cleans and inspects
4. **Standardize** documents how it should be done
5. **Sustain** makes it permanent through discipline and culture

5S is not "just housekeeping"—it's the foundation for quality, safety, efficiency, and continuous improvement. Shadow boards, visual management, and regular audits reinforce standards. The key to success is **sustaining**—making 5S a daily habit, not a one-time event.

In the next section, we'll explore tool management and control—building on the 5S foundation to create efficient tooling systems.

## Key Takeaways

1. **5S is systematic**: Sort → Set in Order → Shine → Standardize → Sustain
2. **Not just cleaning**: 5S eliminates waste, improves efficiency, and builds quality
3. **Visual management**: Shadow boards, floor markings, labels make standards obvious
4. **Red tag strategy**: Safe method for removing unnecessary items
5. **Audits and scorecards**: Verify standards are maintained
6. **Sustain is hardest**: Requires leadership, culture, and daily discipline
7. **Foundation for improvement**: Can't improve chaos; must organize first
