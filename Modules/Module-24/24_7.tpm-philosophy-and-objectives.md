# Module 24 – L.E.A.N. Strategies for CNC Manufacturing


## 24.7.1 TPM Philosophy and Objectives

**Total Productive Maintenance (TPM)** is a holistic approach to equipment maintenance that strives to achieve perfect production with no breakdowns, defects, or accidents.

### Philosophy

**Core Belief:** Equipment operators are the first line of defense for equipment health.

**Traditional Maintenance:**
- Operators operate, maintenance fixes
- "Not my job to maintain equipment"
- Reactive: fix when broken
- Maintenance department owns all maintenance

**TPM Philosophy:**
- Operators perform daily maintenance
- Everyone responsible for equipment health
- Proactive: prevent breakdowns
- Shared ownership: operators + maintenance

**Quote from Japan Institute of Plant Maintenance:**
*"TPM involves everyone in the company, from top management to front-line operators, in equipment improvement. It creates a culture where all employees take pride in maintaining their workplace and equipment."*

### Objectives

**Perfect Production:**

**Zero Breakdowns:**
- Equipment runs reliably
- No unplanned downtime
- Predictable production

**Zero Defects:**
- Equipment produces quality parts
- No equipment-related defects
- Process capability maintained

**Zero Accidents:**
- Safe equipment operation
- No injuries from equipment
- Hazards eliminated

**Zero Waste:**
- No scrap from equipment issues
- Efficient operation
- Minimal energy, materials waste

**Maximize OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness):**
- World-class goal: 85%+ OEE
- Focus on the "Six Big Losses"
- Continuous improvement

## 24.7.2 The Six Big Losses

**Equipment losses that reduce OEE:**

### Loss Categories

**1. Downtime Losses (Availability):**

**1. Breakdowns (Equipment Failure):**
- Unplanned stops
- Equipment malfunction
- Component failure
- Result: No production

**Example:** Spindle bearing failure stops CNC machine for 8 hours

**2. Setup and Adjustments:**
- Changeover time
- Warmup time
- Calibration
- Result: Planned downtime

**Example:** 45-minute setup between jobs

**2. Speed Losses (Performance):**

**3. Small Stops and Idling:**
- Minor stoppages < 5 minutes
- Jams, misfeeds
- Sensor trips
- Clearing chips
- Result: Frequent interruptions

**Example:** Chip bird nest stops machine 3 min, happens 10× per shift

**4. Reduced Speed:**
- Running slower than design speed
- Not optimal parameters
- Wear/aging equipment
- Result: Lower output

**Example:** CNC capable of 200 IPM rapids but running at 150 IPM due to vibration

**3. Quality Losses (Quality):**

**5. Startup Defects (Process Defects):**
- Defects during startup/warmup
- Setup-related defects
- First-off scrap
- Result: Scrap + rework time

**Example:** First 3 parts after setup out of tolerance

**6. Production Defects:**
- Defects during normal operation
- Equipment-caused defects (not design)
- Tool wear, calibration drift
- Result: Scrap + rework time

**Example:** Part dimension drift due to spindle thermal growth

### Impact

**Six Big Losses typically account for:**
- 5-20% for breakdowns
- 1-10% for setup/adjustments
- 2-10% for small stops
- 2-15% for reduced speed
- 1-5% for startup defects
- 1-5% for production defects

**Total Loss: 15-50% of potential production!**

**TPM Goal: Eliminate or minimize all six losses.**

## 24.7.3 Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)

**OEE** is the metric for TPM success.

### Definition

**OEE = Availability × Performance × Quality**

**OEE measures how effectively equipment is utilized when scheduled to run.**

### 24.7.3.1 Availability

**Availability:** Percentage of scheduled time equipment actually runs.

**Formula:**

**Availability = Operating Time ÷ Planned Production Time**

**Where:**
- **Planned Production Time** = Available time - planned downtime (breaks, meetings)
- **Operating Time** = Planned time - downtime (breakdowns, setups)

**Example:**
- Shift: 8 hours = 480 minutes
- Breaks: 30 minutes (planned)
- **Planned Production Time: 450 minutes**
- Breakdown: 45 minutes
- Setup: 30 minutes
- **Operating Time: 450 - 45 - 30 = 375 minutes**

**Availability = 375 ÷ 450 = 83.3%**

**Losses affecting Availability:**
- Breakdowns
- Setups/changeovers

### 24.7.3.2 Performance

**Performance:** Speed efficiency—running at design cycle time.

**Formula:**

**Performance = (Ideal Cycle Time × Parts Produced) ÷ Operating Time**

**Where:**
- **Ideal Cycle Time** = Design/nameplate speed
- **Parts Produced** = Total output
- **Operating Time** = From availability calc

**Example:**
- Ideal cycle time: 1.5 minutes/part
- Parts produced: 200
- Operating time: 375 minutes

**Performance = (1.5 × 200) ÷ 375 = 300 ÷ 375 = 80%**

**Losses affecting Performance:**
- Small stops (reduce effective time)
- Reduced speed (longer cycle time)

### 24.7.3.3 Quality

**Quality:** Percentage of good parts (no defects, no rework).

**Formula:**

**Quality = Good Parts ÷ Total Parts Produced**

**Example:**
- Total parts produced: 200
- Scrap: 5 parts
- Rework: 3 parts
- Good parts: 200 - 5 - 3 = 192

**Quality = 192 ÷ 200 = 96%**

**Losses affecting Quality:**
- Startup defects
- Production defects

### 24.7.3.4 Calculating OEE

**OEE = Availability × Performance × Quality**

**Example (continuing from above):**
- Availability = 83.3%
- Performance = 80%
- Quality = 96%

**OEE = 0.833 × 0.80 × 0.96 = 0.64 = 64%**

**Interpretation: Equipment produces 64% of its theoretical maximum.**

**36% is lost to the six big losses!**

### 24.7.3.5 Using OEE for Improvement

**OEE Benchmarks:**
- **< 65%:** Uncompetitive, major improvement needed
- **65-75%:** Typical for many manufacturers
- **75-85%:** Good, approaching world-class
- **85%+:** World-class performance
- **100%:** Theoretical maximum (impossible in reality)

**Using OEE:**

**1. Baseline Measurement:**
- Calculate current OEE
- Understand which losses largest
- Prioritize improvements

**2. Track Trends:**
- Weekly or monthly OEE
- Is it improving?
- Identify regression

**3. Diagnose Issues:**

**Low Availability (Breakdowns, Setups):**
- Focus: Autonomous maintenance, preventive maintenance, SMED

**Low Performance (Small Stops, Speed):**
- Focus: Root cause analysis of stops, equipment optimization

**Low Quality (Defects):**
- Focus: Process capability, calibration, tooling

**4. Set Targets:**
- Realistic improvement goals
- Example: 64% → 70% in 6 months → 75% in 1 year

**5. Drive Continuous Improvement:**
- Small improvements in all three areas compound
- Example: 83% Avail → 90% (+7%), 80% Perf → 85% (+5%), 96% Qual → 98% (+2%)
- **OEE: 64% → 75%** (17% improvement)

**OEE Loss Tree Analysis:**

Identify exactly where losses occur:
```
OEE: 64%
├─ Availability: 83.3%
│  ├─ Breakdowns: 10%
│  └─ Setups: 6.7%
├─ Performance: 80%
│  ├─ Small stops: 12%
│  └─ Reduced speed: 8%
└─ Quality: 96%
   ├─ Startup defects: 2%
   └─ Production defects: 2%
```

**Biggest loss: Small stops (12%)** → Focus here first

- Maintains concentration (tool life, finish)

**Lubrication Failures:**
- Prevents way wear, backlash
- Extends machine life

**Hydraulic Leaks:**
- Early detection prevents major failures

### OEE for CNC

**Typical CNC OEE (without TPM): 40-60%**

**Availability losses:**
- Breakdowns: Hydraulic failures, electronics, spindle

**Performance losses:**
- Small stops: Chip bird nests, tool magazine issues
- Reduced speed: Fear of vibration, crashes

**Quality losses:**
- Startup defects: Thermal growth, setup errors
- Production defects: Tool wear, machine drift

**With TPM + SMED: 75-85% OEE achievable**

## Summary

Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) maximizes equipment effectiveness through operator-involved maintenance, eliminating the Six Big Losses. OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) measures success: Availability × Performance × Quality. World-class OEE is 85%+.

The Eight Pillars of TPM provide a comprehensive framework, with Autonomous Maintenance as the foundation. Operators perform daily cleaning, inspection, and minor maintenance, preventing failures and defect deterioration. The seven steps develop operator capabilities progressively, from initial cleaning to full autonomous maintenance.

For CNC machines, TPM focuses on chip management, coolant maintenance, lubrication, and early detection of wear. Combined with SMED, TPM dramatically improves OEE from typical 40-60% to world-class 75-85%.
