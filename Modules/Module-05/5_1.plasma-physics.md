# Module 5 – Plasma Cutting

## 1. Introduction to Plasma Cutting: Fundamentals and Industrial Context

### 1.1 The Physics of Plasma: The Fourth State of Matter

Plasma cutting harnesses the fourth state of matter—beyond solid, liquid, and gas—to achieve metal cutting speeds and edge quality unattainable by mechanical methods. When gas is heated beyond 10,000 K, its atoms ionize, forming a conductive mixture of free electrons, positive ions, and neutral particles. This **plasma** conducts electric current and concentrates energy densities approaching 10⁸ W/m², sufficient to melt and vaporize steel in milliseconds.

**Plasma Arc Fundamentals:**

The plasma cutting process establishes an electric arc between a tungsten-hafnium electrode (cathode) inside the torch and the workpiece (anode). Gas flowing through a constricting nozzle is superheated by the arc to 20,000–30,000 K, ionizing into plasma. The constricted nozzle accelerates this plasma to velocities of 300–900 m/s (Mach 1–3), creating a jet that simultaneously:

1. **Melts** the metal (steel melts at ~1,800 K; plasma delivers 20,000 K)
2. **Blows away** molten material via kinetic energy transfer (momentum flux)
3. **Oxidizes** ferrous metals when using oxygen or air plasma gas (exothermic reaction adds heat)

The result: a narrow kerf (0.5–3 mm) with minimal heat-affected zone (HAZ), enabling rapid cutting of conductive metals from 0.5 mm sheet to 50+ mm plate.

### 1.2 Advantages Over Alternative Cutting Processes

Plasma cutting occupies a unique position in the fabrication process spectrum, offering trade-offs that make it the optimal choice for specific applications:

**Comparison with Oxyfuel (Torch) Cutting:**

| Parameter | Oxyfuel | Plasma | Advantage |
|-----------|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Cut speed (10mm steel)** | 200–400 mm/min | 2,000–4,000 mm/min | **Plasma 5–10× faster** |
| **Maximum thickness** | 300+ mm | 50 mm (typical) | Oxyfuel for heavy plate |
| **Materials** | Ferrous only | All conductive metals | **Plasma versatile** |
| **Kerf width** | 3–6 mm | 1–3 mm | **Plasma narrower** |
| **Edge quality** | Good (square edge) | Fair (5–15° bevel) | Oxyfuel cleaner |
| **Operating cost** | Low (gases only) | Moderate (consumables + power) | Oxyfuel cheaper |

**Comparison with Laser Cutting:**

| Parameter | Laser (CO₂/Fiber) | Plasma | Advantage |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|-----------|
| **Capital cost** | $150k–$500k+ | $5k–$50k | **Plasma 10–100× lower** |
| **Cut speed (3mm steel)** | 5,000–15,000 mm/min | 3,000–6,000 mm/min | Laser faster on thin |
| **Thickness capacity** | 25 mm (practical) | 50 mm | **Plasma for thick** |
| **Edge quality** | Excellent (0–3° bevel) | Fair (5–15° bevel) | Laser superior |
| **Kerf width** | 0.1–0.3 mm | 1–3 mm | Laser narrower |
| **Reflective metals (Al)** | Difficult (CO₂) | Easy | **Plasma no issues** |

**Key Takeaway:** Plasma cutting is the **economic optimum** for:
- **Mild steel, 3–25 mm thickness** (sweet spot)
- **High-volume structural fabrication** (HVAC, shipbuilding, agriculture)
- **Aluminum and stainless steel** cutting where laser cost is prohibitive
- **Portable cutting** applications (construction sites, repair work)

### 1.3 CNC Plasma Tables: Automation and Precision

Manual plasma cutting, while versatile, suffers from operator fatigue, inconsistent torch height, and lack of repeatability. **CNC plasma tables** automate torch motion to achieve:

**Repeatability:** Position accuracy ±0.1–0.5 mm enables cutting multiple identical parts from a single program, critical for production runs (brackets, gussets, flanges).

**Complexity:** CNC controllers execute arbitrary 2D shapes from CAD/CAM software—impossible to cut manually. Examples: gear profiles, artistic designs, puzzle-jointed structural members.

**Torch Height Control (THC):** Closed-loop systems monitor arc voltage (proportional to torch-to-work distance) and adjust Z-axis in real-time, maintaining optimal standoff (1–2 mm) despite warped plate or uneven table. This extends consumable life 3–5× and improves cut quality.

**Productivity:** Automated nesting software arranges parts to minimize material waste (achieving 85–95% utilization vs. 60–70% manual), while simultaneous cutting with multiple torches scales throughput linearly.

### 1.4 Applications Across Industries

Plasma cutting serves diverse markets where its speed and material versatility provide competitive advantages:

**HVAC Ductwork:** Rectangular and round duct sections, flanges, and dampers cut from galvanized steel and stainless steel. High-speed plasma enables same-day fabrication from CAD drawings.

**Structural Steel Fabrication:** Beam copes, gusset plates, connection tabs, and base plates for building frames. Plasma cuts thicker sections (12–25 mm) faster than laser at lower capital cost.

**Automotive and Heavy Equipment:** Frame rails, brackets, and chassis components. Plasma's tolerance for mill scale and rust (common on hot-rolled steel) reduces pre-processing.

**Shipbuilding:** Bulkhead plates, stiffeners, and hull sections in mild and high-strength low-alloy (HSLA) steels. Plasma handles 25–50 mm plate thicknesses required for structural integrity.

**Artistic and Architectural Metalwork:** Decorative panels, signage, sculptures, and railing infills. CNC plasma enables intricate 2D patterns (filigree, organic shapes) at production speeds.

**Maintenance and Repair:** Portable plasma cutters dismantle obsolete structures, cut rusted bolts, and prepare edges for welding in field conditions where oxy-fuel is impractical.

### 1.5 System Architecture Overview

A complete CNC plasma cutting system integrates five subsystems, each critical to performance:

1. **Plasma Power Supply:** Converts 230V or 480V AC to regulated DC arc current (30–200 A). Includes high-frequency arc starting circuitry and overcurrent protection.

2. **CNC Motion System:** Gantry (X-Y) or cantilever design with servo or stepper motors, typically moving the torch over a stationary table. Z-axis provides initial height setting and THC adjustment.

3. **Torch and Consumables:** Electrode, nozzle, shield cap, and swirl ring form the plasma jet. Consumable life: 200–2,000 pierces depending on material thickness and current.

4. **Gas Supply and Flow Control:** Compressed air (most common), oxygen, nitrogen, or argon-hydrogen mixtures. Regulator maintains 4–6 bar pressure; flowmeter ensures 60–150 L/min flow rate.

5. **Cutting Table:** Water table (submerged work suppresses fumes and UV radiation) or downdraft table (fan pulls fumes through slats). Includes material support (slats or grating) and dross collection.
