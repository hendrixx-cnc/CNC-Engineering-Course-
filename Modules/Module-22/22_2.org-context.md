## 22.2.3 The Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) Cycle

The **PDCA Cycle** (also called Deming Cycle or Shewhart Cycle) is the fundamental improvement methodology embedded in ISO 9001:2015.

### PDCA Overview

```
     PLAN
      ↓
ACT ← → DO
      ↑
    CHECK
```

### Plan Phase

**Establish objectives and processes necessary to deliver results**

Activities:
- Identify problem or improvement opportunity
- Analyze current situation (data collection)
- Determine root causes
- Develop solution or improvement plan
- Set targets and success criteria
- Identify resources needed

### Do Phase

**Implement the plan**

Activities:
- Execute plan on small scale (pilot or trial)
- Train personnel on new method
- Collect data on performance
- Document what happens

### Check Phase

**Monitor and measure processes and products against policies, objectives, and requirements, and report results**

Activities:
- Compare actual results to expected results
- Analyze data
- Identify gaps and variances
- Determine if objectives met

### Act Phase

**Take actions to continually improve process performance**

Activities:
- If successful: Standardize and implement broadly (update procedures, train everyone)
- If not successful: Identify lessons learned and return to Plan phase
- Identify next improvement opportunity
- Continue the cycle

### PDCA in ISO 9001:2015 Structure

ISO 9001:2015 structure follows PDCA:

**PLAN** (Clauses 4-6):
- Context and interested parties
- Leadership and planning
- Risks and opportunities
- Quality objectives

**DO** (Clauses 7-8):
- Support and resources
- Operational planning and control
- Production and service provision

**CHECK** (Clause 9):
- Monitoring, measurement, analysis, evaluation
- Customer satisfaction
- Internal audits
- Management review

**ACT** (Clause 10):
- Nonconformity and corrective action
- Continual improvement

### PDCA Example: Reducing Scrap

**PLAN**:
- Problem: Scrap rate is 5%, target is 2%
- Analyze: Pareto chart shows 60% of scrap is dimension errors on turned diameters
- Root cause: Tool wear not monitored, cutting past tool life
- Solution: Implement tool life tracking system
- Target: Reduce scrap to <2% within 3 months

**DO**:
- Conduct tool life study on problematic operation
- Establish replacement interval (e.g., 200 parts)
- Program ERP to track parts run on each tool
- Train operators on tool replacement procedure
- Implement on one machine as pilot

**CHECK**:
- Monitor scrap rate on pilot machine for 30 days
- Scrap rate drops from 5% to 1.5%
- Tool changes consistently at proper interval
- No issues with procedure compliance

**ACT**:
- Standardize tool life tracking on all machines
- Update work instructions
- Train all operators
- Continue monitoring scrap rate monthly
- Identify next improvement opportunity

## 22.2.4 Risk-Based Thinking

**Risk-Based Thinking** is a key concept introduced in ISO 9001:2015, replacing the former requirement for preventive action.

### What is Risk-Based Thinking?

Risk-based thinking means considering risk in all aspects of the QMS, not just in formal risk assessments.

**Risk**: Effect of uncertainty on expected results
- Can be positive (opportunity) or negative (threat)
- Not all risks require formal analysis

### Risk-Based Thinking vs. Preventive Action

**ISO 9001:2008** had separate clause for Preventive Action (8.5.3)

**ISO 9001:2015** integrates risk thinking throughout standard:
- Risk assessment in planning (Clause 6.1)
- Risk considerations in all processes
- Preventive action built-in, not separate

### Levels of Risk Management

**Informal Risk Thinking** (everyday decisions):
- Choosing which machine to use based on capability
- Deciding when to change tools
- Determining inspection frequency
- Selecting suppliers

**Formal Risk Assessment** (documented analysis):
- Major equipment investments
- New product launches
- Supplier qualification
- Process validation

**Advanced Risk Analysis** (quantitative methods):
- FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis)
- Fault Tree Analysis
- Probabilistic risk assessment

### Risk-Based Thinking in Practice

**Product Design**:
- What could go wrong in manufacturing?
- Design for manufacturability (DFM)
- Identify critical characteristics requiring special controls

**Process Planning**:
- What are failure modes for this operation?
- What controls prevent defects? (fixtures, tool monitoring, in-process checks)
- What if machine breaks down? (backup machine, outsource capability)

**Supplier Selection**:
- Risk of single-source supplier (supply disruption)
- Opportunity: Develop second source
- Risk of poor quality from new supplier
- Mitigation: Trial order, incoming inspection, audits

**Change Management**:
- What could go wrong with this change?
- How to minimize risk? (trials, training, phased implementation)
- What's worst-case scenario? (contingency plan)

### Benefits of Risk-Based Thinking

- Proactive rather than reactive
- Prevents problems rather than correcting them
- Focuses resources on greatest risks
- Improves decision-making
- Reduces firefighting and crises
- Increases likelihood of achieving objectives

## 22.2.5 Process Approach to Quality Management

The **Process Approach** is a fundamental principle of ISO 9001, emphasizing management of activities as interrelated processes rather than isolated functions.

### What is a Process?

**Process**: Set of interrelated activities that transform inputs into outputs

```
Inputs → [Process Activities] → Outputs
         ↑ Controls
         ↓ Resources
```

**Example Process: CNC Machining**
- **Inputs**: Raw material, drawing, program, work order
- **Activities**: Setup, load material, run program, inspect
- **Outputs**: Machined part
- **Controls**: Control plan, work instruction, proven program
- **Resources**: CNC machine, tooling, fixtures, operator, measuring equipment

### Process Approach Benefits

- Focuses on achieving results
- Identifies interactions between processes
- Optimizes system performance (not just individual departments)
- Reduces duplication and inefficiency
- Improves consistency and predictability

### Process Categories

**Management Processes**: Direct and support organization
- Strategic planning
- Management review
- Internal audits
- Corrective action

**Core Processes**: Directly create value for customer
- Sales and quoting
- Order entry
- Production planning
- Manufacturing operations
- Inspection and testing
- Shipping

**Support Processes**: Enable core processes
- Document control
- Training
- Equipment maintenance
- Calibration
- Purchasing

### Process Identification and Mapping

**Steps to Implement Process Approach**:

1. **Identify processes** needed for QMS
2. **Determine sequence and interaction** of processes
3. **Define criteria and methods** for effective operation and control
4. **Ensure availability of resources** and information
5. **Monitor, measure, and analyze** processes
6. **Implement actions** to achieve planned results and continual improvement

**Process Mapping Tools**:

**Flowchart**: Shows sequence of activities
```
Start → Activity 1 → Decision? → Yes → Activity 2 → End
                       ↓ No
                   Activity 3 →↑
```

**Turtle Diagram**: Shows inputs, outputs, controls, resources

```
         INPUTS                        OUTPUTS
           ↓                              ↑
    ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                          │
    │           PROCESS NAME                   │
    │                                          │
    └──────────────────────────────────────────┘
       ↑                                    ↑
    CONTROLS                            RESOURCES
```

**SIPOC Diagram**: Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Customers

| Suppliers | Inputs | Process | Outputs | Customers |
|-----------|--------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Material supplier | Bar stock | CNC Machining | Machined shaft | Assembly dept |
| Engineering | Drawing | | | |
| Programming | NC program | | | |

### Process Performance Indicators

Each process should have measurable indicators:

**Machining Process Example**:
- Cycle time (hours per part)
- First-pass yield (% passing inspection first time)
- Machine utilization (% of available time running)
- Scrap rate (% of material scrapped)
- Setup time (minutes per job)

**Inspection Process Example**:
- Inspection turnaround time (hours from receipt to release)
- Inspection accuracy (agreement with external inspection)
- Backlog (jobs waiting for inspection)

### Process Ownership

Each process should have an **owner**:
- Responsible for process performance
- Authority to make process changes
- Monitors process metrics
- Drives process improvement

**Example**:
- Machining Process Owner: Production Manager
- Inspection Process Owner: Quality Manager
- Calibration Process Owner: QA Lead

### Process Interactions

Processes don't operate in isolation; outputs of one process become inputs to another.

**Example Interaction**:
```
Purchase Order → Purchasing Process → Material Receipt →
Receiving Inspection → Machining Process → Finished Part →
Final Inspection → Shipping Process → Customer
```

Understanding interactions helps:
- Identify bottlenecks
- Improve handoffs
- Reduce errors and rework
- Optimize overall system
