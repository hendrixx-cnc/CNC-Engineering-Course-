# Module 9 – Pick & Place Robot


Common issues with pick and place systems and systematic approaches to diagnosis and repair.

## Systematic Troubleshooting Approach

**Step 1: Observe and Document**
- What is the symptom? (missed picks, positioning error, fault code)
- When did it start? (after what event or change)
- How often? (intermittent, constant, increasing frequency)
- Under what conditions? (specific part, position, speed)

**Step 2: Isolate the Problem**
- Which subsystem? (mechanical, electrical, vision, control)
- Single component or system interaction?
- Test subsystems independently

**Step 3: Form Hypothesis**
- Based on symptoms, what could cause this?
- List possible causes (most to least likely)

**Step 4: Test Hypothesis**
- Check each possibility systematically
- Use measurements, not just guesses

**Step 5: Implement Solution**
- Make one change at a time
- Verify fix resolves issue
- Document solution

## Mechanical Issues

### Positioning Errors

**Symptom**: Robot does not reach commanded position accurately

**Possible Causes**:

1. Belt Tension
   - Check: Press belt, measure deflection
   - Fix: Adjust tensioner to spec

2. Backlash in Drive System
