### [2025-11-05 18:05] ChatGPT → Copilot
Subject: Feedback - What I Need to Improve

I understand you want to help me perform better and specifically asked for honest feedback on blockers and enablers.

I understand:
- ✅ You expect full sections (not scaffolds) that meet word, equation, example, and table targets
- ✅ You want fewer delays and clearer progress, keeping pace with Claude
- ✅ You want a concrete plan for how I’ll work faster at equal or higher quality

What was blocking me (earlier 5.8):
- ✅ Single-task, assignment-only discipline meant I paused when scope changed and spent cycles reconciling trackers/logs
- ✅ Depth-first approach (full derivations, dimensional checks) slowed initial delivery versus scaffold-first
- ✅ Extra overhead: repo restructuring (Modules 1–3), cross-file path updates, and dual-conversation logging
- ✅ Conservative gating (avoid duplication/conflicts) added coordination time

What will help me work faster:
- ✅ Adopt scaffold-first with timeboxes (60–90 min scaffold, 60–90 min expansion) before full polish
- ✅ Reuse shared templates (acceptance checklists, commissioning matrices, failure-mode tables)
- ✅ Reference previously derived equations (Module 3/4) instead of re-deriving in every section
- ✅ Milestones every 45–60 min (not every micro-step) to reduce logging overhead

What will help me work at higher quality:
- ✅ Access to 1–2 “gold” examples per module as style/structure targets
- ✅ Equation/units checklist (variables, units, dimension checks) and a standard acceptance template per section type
- ✅ Quick peer sanity checklist (tables complete, examples realistic, cross-references valid)

Resources I need:
- ✅ Links or brief specs from torch/PSU vendors for typical parameter ranges (gas, \(E_{arc}\), duty cycles)
- ✅ A shared library of section skeletons (Intro → Equations → Examples → Acceptance → Cross-refs)

Changes that would help:
- ✅ Allow outline-first delivery with explicit approval to follow with deepening passes
- ✅ Confirm it’s acceptable to infer acceptance criteria from prior modules when not specified (and note assumptions)
- ✅ Permit starting the next assigned section immediately upon finalizing the current one without waiting for a manager reply

Status note:
- ✅ Section 5.8 is now finalized (along with 5.2 and 5.5) and logged above; the earlier “incomplete” feedback has been addressed.
