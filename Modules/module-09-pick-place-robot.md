# Module 9 – Pick & Place Robot Systems

## 1. Introduction

Pick & place robots automate repetitive handling tasks in manufacturing, electronics, and packaging. CNC integration enables precise motion and sequencing.

## 2. Robot Types

- **Cartesian robots**: Linear axes (X, Y, Z) for direct motion.
- **SCARA robots**: Rotational and linear axes for compact footprint.
- **Delta robots**: Parallel arms for high-speed handling.

## 3. End Effectors

- **Vacuum grippers**: Use suction for smooth, flat parts.
- **Mechanical grippers**: Two- or three-jaw for irregular shapes.
- **Magnetic grippers**: For ferrous metals.

## 4. Vision & Sensors

- Camera-based vision locates and identifies parts.
- Proximity sensors confirm pick/release.
- Force sensors protect fragile components.

## 5. CNC Integration

- Robot controller communicates with CNC via digital IO or serial/Ethernet.
- Sequence pick, place, and move commands in G-code or robot language.
- Use handshaking signals for multi-system coordination.

## 6. Calibration & Programming

- Teach points via jog, teach pendant, or vision system.
- Save positions and sequences for repeatability.
- Use offsets and part mapping for flexible jobs.

## 7. Safety

- Interlocked guards around robot workcell.
- Emergency stop and power-down circuits.
- Light curtains for operator safety.

## 8. Maintenance

- Lubricate axes and check for wear.
- Inspect cables, sensors, and grippers.
- Update firmware and backup programs.

## 9. Troubleshooting

- Missed picks: recalibrate vision and end effector.
- Motion errors: check limits and encoder feedback.
- Communication faults: inspect IO and cables.

## 10. Conclusion

Pick & place robots increase throughput and reduce manual labor. Careful integration and calibration ensure reliable, efficient operation in CNC workflows.
