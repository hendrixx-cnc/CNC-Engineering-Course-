# Module 26 – CNC Business Ownership and Management


## Overview

Financial management is often the weakest area for technically skilled business owners. Many excellent machinists fail in business not because they can't make good parts, but because they don't understand their numbers. You can have a shop full of customers and running machines, yet still go bankrupt if you don't manage cash flow, price correctly, or understand your true costs.

This section covers the fundamentals of accounting and financial management specifically for CNC manufacturing businesses: setting up your accounting system, understanding financial statements, calculating true costs and profitable pricing, managing cash flow, budgeting, and tracking key financial metrics.

**Important:** This section provides general guidance. Accounting rules and tax regulations vary and change frequently. Work with a qualified CPA or accountant for your specific situation.

## 4.1 Setting Up Your Accounting System

### 4.1.1 Cash vs. Accrual Accounting

**Two Methods of Accounting:**

**Cash Basis Accounting**

**How it Works:**
- Record income when cash is received
- Record expenses when cash is paid
- Ignore accounts receivable and accounts payable

**Example:**
- You complete a $5,000 job in December
- Customer pays in January
- Cash basis: Revenue recorded in January (when paid)
- You buy $2,000 of materials in December on credit
- You pay supplier in January
- Cash basis: Expense recorded in January (when paid)

**Advantages:**
- ✓ Simple and straightforward
- ✓ Matches your bank account
- ✓ Only pay tax on money actually received
- ✓ Easy to understand cash position

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ Doesn't reflect true profitability in given period
- ✗ Can distort financial picture (revenue/expenses in different periods)
- ✗ Not GAAP-compliant (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles)
- ✗ Not allowed for businesses with inventory >$25M annual revenue
- ✗ Makes financial analysis difficult

**Accrual Basis Accounting**

**How it Works:**
- Record income when earned (when you complete the work), regardless of when paid
- Record expenses when incurred (when you receive goods/services), regardless of when paid
- Track accounts receivable (owed to you) and accounts payable (you owe)

**Example:**
- You complete a $5,000 job in December
- Customer pays in January
- Accrual basis: Revenue recorded in December (when earned)
- Accounts receivable: $5,000 (asset)
- When customer pays in January: Reduce A/R, increase cash
- You buy $2,000 of materials in December on credit
- Accrual basis: Expense recorded in December (when incurred)
- Accounts payable: $2,000 (liability)
- When you pay in January: Reduce A/P, reduce cash

**Advantages:**
- ✓ Reflects true profitability in each period
- ✓ Matches revenue with related expenses
- ✓ Better for financial analysis and decision-making
- ✓ GAAP-compliant
- ✓ Required for inventory-based businesses over certain threshold
- ✓ Better for lenders and investors (more accurate picture)

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ More complex
- ✗ Requires tracking receivables and payables
- ✗ May pay tax on income not yet collected
- ✗ Doesn't directly show cash position

**Which to Choose?**

**Cash Basis Appropriate For:**
- Very small businesses (<$100K revenue)
- Service businesses without inventory
- Businesses with immediate payment (credit card, cash)
- Simplicity is priority

**Accrual Basis Appropriate For:**
- Manufacturing businesses (inventory-based)
- Businesses with payment terms (Net 30, etc.)
- Growing businesses seeking financing
- When accurate profitability tracking essential

**Recommendation for CNC Shops:**

**Start with Accrual Basis.** Even if small, manufacturing involves:
- Material inventory
- Work in progress
- Customer payment terms (Net 30)
- Supplier payment terms

Accrual accounting provides a more accurate picture of profitability and is required for inventory management.

**IRS Allows Hybrid:** You can use accrual for financial statements but cash basis for tax returns (if eligible), giving you benefits of both.

### 4.1.2 Accounting Software Selection

**Do NOT Use:**
- ✗ Excel spreadsheets alone (error-prone, time-consuming, limited functionality)
- ✗ Shoebox and receipts (disaster)
- ✗ Your memory (guaranteed failure)

**Do Use: Professional Accounting Software**

**Popular Options for Small CNC Shops:**

**QuickBooks Online**
- **Best For:** Most small to medium CNC shops

- Or Wave (free) if budget extremely tight and operation very simple

**Year 3+ (Growing, employees, >$200K revenue):**
- QuickBooks Desktop Premier Manufacturing: $550/year
- Or QuickBooks Online Plus with apps for advanced features

**What About ERP Systems?**

ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems like E2 Shop System, JobBOSS, or Jobscope integrate accounting, job tracking, inventory, and production management.

**When to Consider ERP:**
- Revenue >$1M
- Multiple employees
- Complex job tracking needs
- Want integrated system (quoting through invoicing)

**Cost:** $5,000-50,000+ (setup + monthly fees)

**Recommendation:** Start with QuickBooks + job tracking apps. Move to ERP when revenue and complexity justify investment (typically Year 5-7+).

2. **Don't Over-Complicate:** Too many accounts creates confusion. Start simple and add detail only when needed.

3. **Separate COGS from Expenses:** Direct costs (COGS) affect gross margin; operating expenses don't. Keep them separate.

4. **Use Sub-Accounts:** Group related items. Example:
   - Utilities (parent)
     - Electric (sub)
     - Gas (sub)
     - Water (sub)

5. **Match Tax Categories:** Structure to make tax preparation easier (ask your accountant).

6. **Job Costing:** If tracking costs by job, use job/class features in software rather than creating accounts per job.

**Key Metrics from P&L:**

**Gross Profit:** Revenue - COGS = $186,400
- Shows profitability of actual production
- Before operating expenses

**Gross Margin:** (Gross Profit / Revenue) × 100 = 64.8%
- **Target for CNC Shops: 50-65%**
- Higher is better (more efficient production or better pricing)

**Operating Profit (EBITDA):** Gross Profit - Operating Expenses = $39,200
- Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization
- Shows operational profitability

**Operating Margin:** (Operating Profit / Revenue) × 100 = 13.6%
- **Target for CNC Shops: 10-20%**

**Net Profit:** Operating Profit - Interest - Depreciation - Taxes = $12,400
- Bottom line profit
- What's left after all expenses

**Net Margin:** (Net Profit / Revenue) × 100 = 4.3%
- **Target for CNC Shops: 5-15%**
- Lower in example due to depreciation and startup equipment loans

**What to Look For:**

- **Declining Gross Margin:** Material costs increasing, pricing too low, inefficiency
- **High Operating Expenses:** Overhead too high, need to reduce costs or increase revenue
- **Negative Net Profit:** Losing money—need immediate action
- **Trends:** Compare month-to-month and year-over-year to identify patterns

**Assets = Liabilities + Equity**

In this example: $277,500 = $155,500 + $122,000 ✓

**Key Metrics from Balance Sheet:**

**Working Capital:** Current Assets - Current Liabilities
- $81,500 - $35,500 = $46,000
- Measures short-term financial health
- **Target: Positive and sufficient to cover 2-3 months operating expenses**

**Current Ratio:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities
- $81,500 / $35,500 = 2.3
- Measures ability to pay short-term obligations
- **Target: >1.5** (above 1.0 means can cover obligations)

**Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** Total Liabilities / Total Equity
- $155,500 / $122,000 = 1.27
- Measures financial leverage
- **Target: <2.0** for small businesses (lower is less risky)

**Quick Ratio (Acid Test):** (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
- ($81,500 - $18,600) / $35,500 = 1.77
- Measures ability to pay obligations without selling inventory
- **Target: >1.0**

**What to Look For:**

- **Cash Balance:** Adequate for upcoming needs? Trend up or down?
- **Accounts Receivable:** Growing faster than revenue (collection problem)? Aging (old receivables)?
- **Inventory:** Growing (cash tied up, obsolete inventory)?
- **Liabilities:** Manageable? Able to service debt?
- **Equity:** Growing (retained earnings) or shrinking (losses, withdrawals)?

### 4.2.3 Cash Flow Statement

**What It Shows:**
Movement of cash in and out of the business over a period.

**Why Important:**
- You can be profitable on paper but run out of cash (cash vs. accrual timing)
- Shows where cash is coming from and going to
- Critical for understanding liquidity

- Typically negative (using cash to invest in growth)

**3. Financing Activities:** Cash from/to owners and lenders
- Loans, owner investments, distributions, loan payments
- Positive if raising capital, negative if paying down debt/distributions

**What to Look For:**

- **Operating Cash Flow Positive:** Business generating cash from operations (good)
- **Operating Cash Flow Negative:** Burning cash (unsustainable long-term)
- **Large Investing:** Heavy capital investments (growth)
- **Financing Needs:** Requiring loans/capital to fund operations or growth

**Cash Flow vs. Profit:**

**Example: Profitable but Cash-Poor**
- Net profit: $20,000
- But customers owe $40,000 (A/R increase)
- And you bought $30,000 equipment
- And made $15,000 in loan payments
- Cash flow: +$20K - $40K - $30K - $15K = -$65K (used cash despite profit!)

This is why profitable businesses can fail—they run out of cash.

### 4.2.4 Reading and Understanding Financial Reports

**Monthly Review Process:**

**1. Review P&L**
- Revenue vs. budget/prior year: Growing or declining?
- Gross margin: Consistent or changing? Why?
- Operating expenses: Any unusual items? Trending up?
- Net profit: Profitable? Trend?

**2. Review Balance Sheet**
- Cash: Adequate? Trend?
- A/R: Aging (are customers paying)? Growing?
- Inventory: Reasonable level?
- Liabilities: Debt service manageable?

**3. Review Cash Flow**
- Operating cash flow: Positive or negative?
- Cash needs: Upcoming major expenses?
- Forecast: Will you have enough cash?

**4. Review Key Metrics** (see Section 4.6)
- Gross margin, net margin
- Current ratio
- Days sales outstanding
- Machine utilization

**5. Take Action**
- Address problems (declining margin, cash shortage, late customers)
- Adjust spending if needed
- Update forecasts and budgets

**Questions to Ask:**

- Am I making money? (P&L)
- Do I have enough cash? (Balance Sheet, Cash Flow)
- Are customers paying on time? (A/R aging)
- Are expenses under control? (P&L trends)
- Can I afford upcoming investments? (Cash flow forecast)

## 4.3 Job Costing and Pricing

**Job costing** is determining the true cost of each job. **Pricing** is setting the sale price to achieve desired profit.

### 4.3.1 Direct Costs (Material, Labor, Tooling)

**Direct Costs:** Costs directly attributable to a specific job.

**1. Material Costs**

**Calculation:**
- Volume or weight needed × material cost per unit
- Include scrap/waste factor (material yield)

**Example:**
```
Part requires 3" × 4" × 0.5" aluminum stock
Volume: 3 × 4 × 0.5 = 6 cubic inches
Aluminum 6061: $4.50 per cubic inch (example pricing)
Material cost: 6 cu in × $4.50 = $27.00

But: Need to buy 3" × 4" × 6" bar (12 cu in minimum)
Actual material cost: 12 cu in × $4.50 = $54.00
Cost per part (if making 10 parts from bar): $54 ÷ 10 = $5.40/part

Or: Use scrap factor
Usable material: 85% (15% scrap/waste)
Material needed: 6 cu in ÷ 0.85 = 7.06 cu in
Cost: 7.06 × $4.50 = $31.77
```

**Tips:**
- Track actual material usage to refine estimates
- Consider material drop/remnants (can use for other jobs)
- Include freight/shipping in material cost
- Build in scrap factor (typically 5-15% depending on complexity)

**2. Direct Labor Costs**

**For shops with employees:**
- Estimate hours × labor rate (including burden—see below)

**Example:**
```
Setup time: 1.5 hours
Run time per part: 0.25 hours
Quantity: 20 parts
Total time: 1.5 + (20 × 0.25) = 6.5 hours

Machinist wage: $25/hour
Labor burden (taxes, benefits): 30%
True labor cost: $25 × 1.30 = $32.50/hour

Direct labor cost: 6.5 hours × $32.50 = $211.25
```

**For owner-operator shops:**
- Don't ignore your labor—you have value!
- Assign yourself a reasonable hourly rate ($25-50/hr depending on experience)
- Or: Calculate labor cost into machine hour rate (see below)

**3. Tooling Costs**

**Consumable Tooling:**
- Cutting tools, drills, endmills, inserts
- Estimate tool cost per job

**Methods:**

**Method A: Specific Tool Cost**
```
Job uses 3 endmills @ $45 each = $135
Insert life: 20 parts, need 10 parts = $25 (5 parts worth)
Total tool cost: $160
```

**Method B: Tool Cost Factor**
```
Typical tooling: 8-12% of material cost
Material cost: $250
Tooling estimate: $250 × 10% = $25
```

**Method C: Included in Machine Hour Rate**
- Calculate average tooling cost per machine hour
- Include in overhead rate (see indirect costs below)

**Recommendation:** For estimating, use Method C (tooling in machine hour rate). For job costing actuals, track specific tool usage.

### 4.3.2 Indirect Costs (Overhead Allocation)

**Indirect Costs (Overhead):** Costs not directly attributable to specific jobs but necessary to run the business.

**Examples:**
- Rent
- Utilities
- Insurance
- Equipment depreciation
- Shop supplies (not job-specific)
- Office expenses
- Salaries (not directly producing)
- Marketing

**Overhead Allocation:**
Distribute indirect costs to jobs to determine true total cost.

**Common Methods:**

**Method 1: Machine Hour Rate**

Calculate cost per machine hour including all overhead.

**Step 1: Calculate Annual Overhead Costs**

```
Facility (rent, utilities):                    $36,500
Equipment (depreciation, maintenance):          $28,000
Insurance:                                       $9,200
Office and admin:                                $8,500
Marketing:                                       $3,600
Misc overhead:                                   $6,200
TOTAL ANNUAL OVERHEAD:                         $92,000
```

**Step 2: Calculate Available Machine Hours**

```
52 weeks × 40 hours = 2,080 hours/year
Less: Holidays, vacation, maintenance: 10% = 208 hours
Available hours: 1,872 hours
Utilization: 70% (realistic)
Billable hours: 1,872 × 70% = 1,310 hours
```

**Step 3: Calculate Overhead Rate per Hour**

```
$92,000 ÷ 1,310 hours = $70.23 per machine hour
```

**Step 4: Add Direct Labor and Tooling (if not separate)**

```
Overhead: $70.23/hr
Direct labor (owner or machinist): $32.50/hr
Tooling/consumables: $8.00/hr (estimated average)
TOTAL MACHINE HOUR RATE: $110.73/hr

Round to: $110/hr (internal cost rate)
```

**Method 2: Percentage of Direct Labor**

```
Overhead: $92,000/year
Direct labor: $50,000/year
Overhead rate: $92,000 ÷ $50,000 = 184%

Job with $200 direct labor:
Overhead allocation: $200 × 184% = $368
Total cost: $200 + $368 = $568
```

**Method 3: Percentage of Direct Costs**

```
Overhead as % of total direct costs (material + labor + tooling)

Example: Overhead rate 150% of direct costs
Direct costs: $500
Overhead: $500 × 150% = $750
Total cost: $1,250
```

**Recommendation:** **Machine hour rate (Method 1)** is most common and appropriate for CNC shops because machine time is the constraining resource.

### 4.3.3 Machine Hour Rate Calculation

**Detailed Machine Hour Rate Formula:**

**Fixed Costs per Machine per Year:**
```
Equipment cost: $125,000
Useful life: 10 years
Annual depreciation: $12,500

Maintenance: $2,500/year
Insurance (allocated): $1,500/year
Facility (allocated, sq ft basis): $6,000/year
Total Fixed Costs: $22,500/year
```

**Variable Costs per Hour:**
```
Power: $2.50/hr (measured or estimated)
Tooling: $8.00/hr (average)
Coolant/consumables: $1.50/hr
Total Variable: $12.00/hr
```

**Available Hours:**
```
2,080 hours/year - 208 (downtime) = 1,872 available hours
Target utilization: 70%
Billable hours: 1,310 hours
```

**Machine Rate Calculation:**
```
Fixed cost per hour: $22,500 ÷ 1,310 = $17.18/hr
Variable cost per hour: $12.00/hr
Direct labor per hour: $32.50/hr
TOTAL COST: $61.68/hr

This is your COST per hour.
```

**Now Add Profit Margin:**
```
Cost: $61.68/hr
Desired margin: 40%
Markup: $61.68 ÷ (1 - 0.40) = $102.80/hr

Or using markup on cost:
Cost: $61.68/hr
Markup: 67% (equivalent to 40% margin)
$61.68 × 1.67 = $103.01/hr

BILLING RATE: $100-105/hr (rounded)
```

**Multiple Machine Rates:**

Different machines have different costs:

| Machine | Cost | Complexity | Billing Rate |
|---------|------|------------|--------------|
| 3-axis mill (basic) | $60/hr | Standard | $85-95/hr |
| 4-axis mill | $70/hr | Advanced | $100-110/hr |
| 5-axis mill | $90/hr | Complex | $130-150/hr |
| Manual lathe | $45/hr | Simple | $65-75/hr |
| CNC lathe | $55/hr | Standard | $80-95/hr |

### 4.3.4 Markup vs. Margin

**Critical Distinction: Markup and Margin are DIFFERENT!**

**Margin:** Profit as % of selling price
**Markup:** Profit as % of cost

**Example:**
```
Cost: $100
Selling Price: $150
Profit: $50

MARGIN: $50 ÷ $150 (selling price) = 33.3%
MARKUP: $50 ÷ $100 (cost) = 50%
```

**Formulas:**

**Calculate Selling Price from Markup:**
```
Selling Price = Cost × (1 + Markup%)
$100 × 1.50 = $150
```

**Calculate Selling Price from Margin:**
```
Selling Price = Cost ÷ (1 - Margin%)
$100 ÷ (1 - 0.333) = $150
```

**Margin to Markup Conversion:**
```
Markup = Margin ÷ (1 - Margin)
33.3% margin = 0.333 ÷ (1 - 0.333) = 0.50 = 50% markup
```

**Markup to Margin Conversion:**
```
Margin = Markup ÷ (1 + Markup)
50% markup = 0.50 ÷ (1 + 0.50) = 0.333 = 33.3% margin
```

**Common Confusion:**
Many business owners think "I need 40% margin" so they add 40% to cost. **WRONG!**

```
Cost: $100
+ 40% = $140
Actual margin: $40 ÷ $140 = 28.6% (not 40%!)

Correct for 40% margin:
$100 ÷ (1 - 0.40) = $166.67
Margin: $66.67 ÷ $166.67 = 40% ✓
```

**Recommended Margins for CNC Shops:**

| Type | Gross Margin Target | Markup Equivalent |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Production work (volume) | 35-45% | 54-82% |
| Job shop (low volume) | 40-50% | 67-100% |
| Prototype/complex | 50-60% | 100-150% |
| Rush jobs | 55-65% | 122-186% |

### 4.3.5 Competitive Pricing Strategies

**Pricing Methods:**

**1. Cost-Plus Pricing (Most Common)**
```
Calculate true cost → Add desired markup → Selling price
```

**Pros:** Ensures profitability, straightforward
**Cons:** Ignores market conditions, may be too high or leave money on table

**2. Market-Based Pricing**
```
Research what competitors charge → Price similarly
```

**Pros:** Competitive, market-driven
**Cons:** May not cover your costs, race to bottom

**3. Value-Based Pricing**
```
Determine value to customer → Price based on value, not cost
```

**Pros:** Capture more profit, aligns price with customer benefit
**Cons:** Subjective, requires deep customer understanding

**Example: Rush Job**
```
Normal lead time: 3 weeks, price $1,000 (cost $600, 40% margin)
Customer needs it in 3 days
Value to customer: Avoid $10,000 production line shutdown
Value-based price: $2,000-3,000 (customer still saves $7,000+)
Your cost: $750 (overtime, expedited material) + opportunity cost
Value-based price justifiable and profitable
```

**4. Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**
```
1. Calculate cost-plus price (floor)
2. Research market prices (comparison)
3. Assess customer value (ceiling)
4. Set price in range that's competitive and profitable
```

**Pricing Considerations:**

**Volume Discounts:**
- Higher quantities = lower per-unit setup cost
- Offer tiered pricing

**Example:**
```
1-10 parts: $50/each
11-50 parts: $42/each
51-100 parts: $38/each
100+: $35/each
```

**Customer Type:**
- Large established customers: Competitive pricing (volume, reliability)
- Small one-off customers: Higher pricing (higher risk, admin burden)
- Rush jobs: Premium pricing (20-50% upside)

**Complexity:**
- Straightforward parts: Market rate
- Complex/tight tolerance: Premium rate (higher risk, expertise)

**Relationship:**
- New customers: Competitive (win business)
- Established customers: Balance (loyalty but also value realized)
- Problematic customers: Premium or decline (not worth hassle)

**Break-Even Analysis:**

Calculate minimum price needed:

```
Fixed costs (setup): $200
Variable cost per part: $15
Quantity: 20 parts

Total cost: $200 + (20 × $15) = $500
Break-even price per part: $500 ÷ 20 = $25/part
Any price > $25/part = profit
```

**Knowing break-even helps with decision-making** (e.g., fill capacity at lower margin vs. idle time).

## 4.4 Cash Flow Management

Cash flow is the lifeblood of business. More businesses fail from cash flow problems than lack of profitability.

### 4.4.1 Cash Flow Forecasting

**Purpose:** Predict future cash needs to avoid shortages.

**Simple Cash Flow Forecast:**

```
CASH FLOW FORECAST - Next 90 Days

Starting Cash (today): $25,000

WEEK 1:
Expected receipts:
  Customer A payment: $5,000
  Customer B payment: $3,200
  Total in: $8,200

Expected payments:
  Rent: $2,500
  Supplier invoices: $4,000
  Payroll: $3,000
  Utilities: $500
  Total out: $10,000

Net cash flow: -$1,800
Ending cash: $23,200

WEEK 2:
Expected receipts: $12,000
Expected payments: $6,500
Net: +$5,500
Ending cash: $28,700

[Continue for 12 weeks]
```

**Identify Cash Crunches:**
If forecast shows cash going negative, take action:
- Accelerate collections (call customers, offer discount for early payment)
- Delay payments (negotiate terms with suppliers)
- Use line of credit
- Reduce discretionary spending
- Delay equipment purchase

**Update Weekly:** Cash flow forecasts become stale quickly. Update weekly with actual results and revised projections.

### 4.4.2 Managing Receivables (Getting Paid)

**Accounts Receivable = Customers owe you money**

**Problem:** You completed work (revenue on P&L), but haven't been paid (no cash). Your money is tied up in receivables.

**Strategies to Accelerate Collections:**

**1. Clear Payment Terms**
- Specify terms on quote/invoice (e.g., "Net 30 days")
- Communicate expectations upfront
- Include late payment terms ("1.5% monthly interest on overdue balances")

**2. Invoice Promptly**
- Send invoice immediately upon job completion
- Don't wait (delay = delay in payment)
- Use online invoicing (email, customer portal)

**3. Payment Options**
- Credit card (instant payment, but 2-3% fee)
- ACH/bank transfer (low cost, 1-2 day clearance)
- Check (slowest)
- Consider deposit or progress payments for large jobs (50% upfront, 50% on completion)

**4. Follow Up on Overdue Accounts**
- Day 1 overdue: Friendly reminder email
- Day 10 overdue: Phone call
- Day 20 overdue: Firm notice (interest accruing)
- Day 45 overdue: Final notice, stop work
- Day 60+ overdue: Collections agency or legal action

**5. Credit Policies**
- Check credit for new customers (D&B, credit references)
- Set credit limits
- COD or prepay for risky customers
- Personal guarantee from owner (small businesses)

**6. Incentives**
- Discount for early payment (e.g., "2% discount if paid within 10 days")
- Note: This costs you 2%, so only if cash flow critical

**7. Aging Reports**
Track receivables by age:

```
A/R AGING REPORT

Current (0-30 days): $18,000 (60%)
31-60 days: $8,000 (27%)
61-90 days: $3,000 (10%)
90+ days: $1,000 (3%)
Total A/R: $30,000
```

**Red Flag:** If >20% of receivables are >60 days, you have a collection problem.

**Days Sales Outstanding (DSO):**
```
DSO = (Accounts Receivable ÷ Revenue) × 365

Example: $30,000 A/R, $285,000 annual revenue
DSO = ($30,000 ÷ $285,000) × 365 = 38.4 days

Interpretation: On average, customers pay in 38 days.
```

**Target:** DSO ≤ payment terms + 10 days (e.g., Net 30 terms → DSO ≤ 40 days)

### 4.4.3 Managing Payables (Paying Bills)

**Accounts Payable = You owe suppliers money**

**Balance:** Pay on time to maintain good relationships, but don't pay too early (preserve cash).

**Strategies:**

**1. Take Full Payment Terms**
- If supplier offers Net 30, pay on day 30 (not day 5)
- Use their money interest-free
- Exception: Early payment discount worth taking (e.g., 2/10 Net 30 = 2% discount if paid in 10 days)

**2. Negotiate Extended Terms**
- Ask for Net 45 or Net 60 if possible
- Especially helpful for material suppliers
- Large orders: Request special terms

**3. Prioritize Payments**
When cash tight, prioritize:
1. Payroll (employees always first, legal requirement)
2. Rent (need facility to operate)
3. Critical suppliers (materials for active jobs)
4. Utilities
5. Equipment loans (protect collateral)
6. Other suppliers
7. Owner distributions (last)

**4. Communicate**
If you can't pay on time:
- Call supplier BEFORE due date
- Explain situation
- Propose payment plan
- Most will work with you if you communicate

**5. Avoid Late Fees and Interest**
- Late fees add up quickly
- Damages relationships
- May cut off credit

### 4.4.4 Working Capital Requirements

**Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities**

**Why It Matters:**
- Funds day-to-day operations
- Buffer for timing differences (you pay suppliers before customers pay you)
- Growth requires working capital (more inventory, larger receivables)

**Rule of Thumb:**
Maintain working capital equal to **2-3 months of operating expenses**.

**Example:**
```
Monthly operating expenses: $12,000
Target working capital: $24,000-36,000
```

**Working Capital Cycle:**

```
Day 1: Buy $2,000 materials (cash out)
Day 7: Complete job (material now WIP inventory)
Day 8: Ship to customer, invoice $5,000 (WIP → A/R)
Day 38: Customer pays (A/R → cash in)

Cash cycle: 38 days (cash out on Day 1, cash in on Day 38)
You're "financing" customer for 38 days with your working capital
```

**As You Grow:**
More jobs in process = more working capital tied up = greater need for working capital

**Sources of Working Capital:**
- Owner investment
- Profits retained in business
- Line of credit (borrow as needed)
- Improved cash conversion (faster collections, slower payables)

## 4.5 Budgeting and Financial Planning

### 4.5.1 Operating Budget

**Annual Operating Budget:**
Planned revenue and expenses for the year.

**Process:**

**1. Revenue Forecast**
```
Base on:
- Prior year actual
- Expected growth rate
- Capacity (machine hours available)
- Market conditions
- Known contracts/customers

Example:
Prior year revenue: $285,000
Expected growth: 15%
Budget: $328,000
```

**2. COGS Budget**
```
Based on revenue and historical gross margin

Revenue budget: $328,000
Target gross margin: 63%
COGS budget: $328,000 × 37% = $121,360
```

**3. Operating Expense Budget**
```
Detail each expense category:
Rent: $30,000 (fixed)
Utilities: $7,000 (+8% increase)
Equipment loans: $24,000 (fixed)
Insurance: $10,000 (+9% increase)
Etc.

Total Operating Expenses: $152,000
```

**4. Profit Projection**
```
Revenue: $328,000
COGS: $121,360
Gross Profit: $206,640 (63%)
Operating Expenses: $152,000
Operating Profit: $54,640 (17%)
```

**5. Monthly Breakdown**
Break annual budget into monthly targets (adjust for seasonality).

### 4.5.2 Capital Budget (Equipment Purchases)

**Capital Budget:** Plan for major equipment and asset purchases.

**Example:**
```
Year 1: No major purchases (focus on operations)
Year 2: Add used lathe: $45,000
Year 3: CMM inspection equipment: $25,000
Year 4: 2nd mill: $140,000
Year 5: Facility expansion: $50,000
```

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- ROI and payback period
- Strategic importance
- Capacity needs
- Financial capability (cash flow, financing)

### 4.5.3 Variance Analysis

**Variance Analysis:** Compare actual results to budget.

**Example:**
```
                Budget    Actual   Variance   %
Revenue:        $27,333   $31,200  +$3,867   +14%
COGS:           $10,113   $12,168  +$2,055   +20%
Gross Profit:   $17,220   $19,032  +$1,812   +11%
Gross Margin:   63.0%     61.0%    -2.0%
Op Expenses:    $12,667   $13,100  +$433     +3%
Net Profit:     $4,553    $5,932   +$1,379   +30%
```

**Analysis:**
- Revenue exceeded budget by 14% (good!)
- But COGS grew by 20% (faster than revenue) → margin compressed
- Why? Material costs up? Pricing too low? Inefficiency?
- Investigate and take corrective action

**Monthly Review:**
- Identify variances
- Understand causes
- Adjust operations or revise budget if needed

## 4.6 Key Financial Metrics

### 4.6.1 Gross Profit Margin

```
Gross Profit Margin = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue × 100
```

**Target for CNC Shops: 50-65%**

**What It Measures:** Profitability of production before operating expenses.

**Low Margin Causes:**
- Pricing too low
- Material costs high
- Inefficiency (excessive scrap, long cycle times)
- Under-quoting jobs

**Actions to Improve:**
- Increase prices
- Negotiate better material pricing
- Improve efficiency
- More accurate quoting

### 4.6.2 Net Profit Margin

```
Net Profit Margin = Net Profit / Revenue × 100
```

**Target for CNC Shops: 5-15%** (after owner reasonable salary)

**What It Measures:** Overall profitability after all expenses.

**Low Net Margin Causes:**
- Low gross margin (see above)
- High operating expenses (overhead)
- Excessive debt service

### 4.6.3 Current Ratio

```
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
```

**Target: >1.5**

**What It Measures:** Ability to pay short-term obligations.

**Ratio < 1.0:** Liquidity crisis—can't pay bills
**Ratio 1.0-1.5:** Marginal—vulnerable
**Ratio > 1.5:** Healthy

### 4.6.4 Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)

```
DSO = (Accounts Receivable / Revenue) × 365
```

**Target: ≤ Payment Terms + 10 days** (e.g., ≤40 days for Net 30 terms)

**What It Measures:** How long customers take to pay.

**High DSO:** Collection problem—cash tied up in receivables

### 4.6.5 Inventory Turnover

```
Inventory Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory
```

**Example:**
```
COGS: $100,000
Average Inventory: $15,000
Turnover: $100,000 / $15,000 = 6.67 times per year
Days in Inventory: 365 / 6.67 = 55 days
```

**What It Measures:** How quickly inventory is used.

**Low Turnover:** Excess/slow-moving inventory—cash tied up
**High Turnover:** Efficient, but risk of stockouts

**Target:** Varies, but 6-12 turns/year typical for job shops.

## 4.7 Working with Accountants and Bookkeepers

**When to Hire Professionals:**

**Immediately (Day 1):**
- Consult with CPA on entity structure, setup, tax implications

**Ongoing:**
- Bookkeeper (in-house, outsourced, or DIY): Monthly
- CPA/Accountant: Quarterly reviews, annual tax prep, strategic advice

**What to Expect from CPA:**
- Tax planning and preparation
- Entity structure advice
- Financial statement review
- Strategic financial advice
- IRS representation (if issues)

**Cost:**
- Bookkeeper: $200-800/month
- CPA: $150-400/hour or $2,000-5,000/year for small business

**How to Get Value:**
- Come prepared (organized records)
- Ask questions
- Proactive communication (don't wait for crisis)
- Follow their advice

**Red Flags (Find New Accountant):**
- Unavailable or unresponsive
- Doesn't understand your business/industry
- Never provides proactive advice
- Errors or missed deadlines
- Doesn't explain things clearly

## Conclusion

Financial management is not optional—it's the foundation of business success. You can be the best machinist in the world, but without understanding your numbers, you'll struggle or fail.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Set Up Properly:** Use accrual accounting and professional software (QuickBooks). Implement good bookkeeping from day one.

2. **Understand Your Statements:** Review P&L, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement monthly. Know what they're telling you.

3. **Know Your Costs:** Calculate true costs including overhead. Use machine hour rates for accurate job costing.

4. **Price for Profit:** Understand margin vs. markup. Price based on cost + desired profit, considering market and value.
