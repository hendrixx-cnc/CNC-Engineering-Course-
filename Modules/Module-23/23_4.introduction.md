# Module 23 – Shop Organization and Management


## Introduction

Tooling represents a significant investment in CNC manufacturing—often $50,000-$500,000+ in inventory. Beyond the capital investment, poor tool management creates:

- **Lost time**: Searching for tools, waiting for tools
- **Duplicate purchases**: Can't find tools, buy more
- **Tool breakage**: Improper storage damages tools
- **Production delays**: Right tool not available when needed
- **Quality issues**: Wrong tool used, causing defects

Effective tool management ensures:
- Right tool, right place, right time
- Minimal investment in tool inventory
- Extended tool life
- Reduced setup time
- Improved quality

This section covers organizing, controlling, and optimizing tooling systems.

## 23.4.1 Tool Crib Organization

The **tool crib** is the centralized storage and distribution point for cutting tools, holders, gages, and related equipment.

### 23.4.1.1 Tool Storage Systems

**Design Goals:**

1. **Visibility**: See what's available at a glance
2. **Accessibility**: Easy to retrieve and return
3. **Protection**: Tools stored safely (no damage)
4. **Organization**: Logical arrangement, easy to find
5. **Security**: Control access if needed (high-value tools)

**Storage Options:**

**1. Modular Drawer Cabinets**

Multi-drawer cabinets with adjustable dividers:
- **Pros**: Protected from dust and damage, high density, lockable
- **Cons**: Can't see contents (must open drawer), more expensive
- **Best for**: Small tools (endmills, drills, inserts), inspection gages

Organization within drawers:
- Foam inserts with cutouts for each tool (like shadow board)
- Divider trays with compartments
- Label outside of drawer with contents

**2. Open Shelving with Bins**

Shelves with plastic bins or trays:
- **Pros**: High visibility, easy access, low cost
- **Cons**: Less protected from dust, can be disorganized if bins not maintained
- **Best for**: Larger quantities, consumables, less-precise tools

Organization:
- Group by tool type on shelves
- Label each bin clearly (type, size, specification)
- Color-code bins by tool type (drills = blue, endmills = red, etc.)

**3. Pegboard and Hooks**

Wall-mounted pegboard with tools hanging:
- **Pros**: Maximum visibility, shadow board integration, low cost
- **Cons**: Limited capacity, dust exposure, tools can fall
- **Best for**: Frequently-used tools, gages, hand tools

Organization:
- Shadow board (tool outline painted)
- Labeled hooks
- Most-used tools at eye level / waist height

**4. Vertical Storage Cabinets (Automated Retrieval)**

Enclosed cabinets with carousel or lift mechanism:
- **Pros**: High density, automated retrieval, security, inventory tracking
- **Cons**: Expensive, requires power, complex
- **Best for**: Large shops, high-value tool inventory, strict control needed

Modern systems integrate with software:
- Scan badge to access
- Select tool from touchscreen
- System delivers tool to window
- Tracks who took what, when

**5. Tool Holder Racks (CAT/BT/HSK Holders)**

Dedicated racks for tool holders:
- Vertical or horizontal orientation
- Holders organized by size (CAT40, CAT50, etc.)
- Numbered locations (corresponds to tool list or storage map)

**Hybrid Approach** (Most Common):

- **Drawers**: Small, delicate tools (endmills, drills, reamers, taps, inserts)
- **Shelving with bins**: Larger quantities, consumables (gloves, coolant additives)
- **Pegboard**: Frequently-used hand tools, gages (shadow boards)
- **Holder racks**: Tool holders organized by machine or size

### 23.4.1.2 Tool Identification and Labeling

Every tool must be clearly identified.

**Information Needed:**

1. **Tool Type**: Endmill, drill, insert, holder, etc.
2. **Size**: Diameter, length, thread size
3. **Specification**: Material (carbide, HSS), coating, geometry
4. **Manufacturer/Part Number**: For reordering
5. **Location**: Where it's stored (for easy return)

**Labeling Methods:**

**1. Bin/Drawer Labels**

Label on front of storage location:
```
┌────────────────────────────┐
│  ENDMILL - 4 FLUTE        │
│  Diameter: 1/2"            │
│  Material: Solid Carbide   │
│  Coating: TiAlN            │
│  Mfg: Kennametal           │
│  Part #: B211A05000HP     │
│  Location: A3-D2-B4        │
│  Min: 2  |  Max: 6         │
└────────────────────────────┘
```

**2. Tool Tags**

Hang tags or labels on individual tools:
- For assembled tools (holder + cutting tool)
- Include: Tool number (T01, T02, etc.), description, machine assignment
- Laminated paper or durable plastic tags

**3. Engraving/Marking**

Permanent marking on tool holder:
- Laser engraving or electric engraver
- Tool number, size, or ID code
- Won't rub off or fade

**4. Color Coding**

Visual system using colored tape, markers, or bands:
- Tool type: Blue = roughing endmill, Red = finishing endmill
- Machine: Cell 1 = yellow, Cell 2 = green
- Size range: 1/4" and under = white, 1/2" = red, 1" = blue

**5. Database/Software**

Tool management software with lookup:
- Enter tool ID or scan barcode → see details
- Track tool location, usage, life
- Generate reports (inventory, usage, cost)

**Standardized Numbering System:**

Create a logical tool numbering system:
- **By machine**: M1-T01, M1-T02, etc. (Machine 1, Tool 1, Tool 2)
- **By type**: EM-0500 (Endmill, 1/2"), DR-0250 (Drill, 1/4")
- **Sequential**: T001, T002, T003 (simple, but less informative)

Consistency is key—everyone uses the same system.

### 23.4.1.3 Tool Kitting and Staging

**Tool Kitting**: Pre-assembling all tools needed for a specific job

**Benefits:**

1. **Faster Setup**: Tools ready, no searching during setup
2. **Complete**: All tools gathered ahead of time (nothing missing)
3. **Quality**: Correct tools selected, verified
4. **Reduced Errors**: Less chance of grabbing wrong tool

**Kitting Process:**

1. **Review Job**: Programmer or setup person reviews CNC program
2. **Create Tool List**: Document every tool needed (type, size, length, offset)
3. **Pull Tools**: Gather from tool crib
4. **Assemble**: Install cutting tools in holders, preset if needed
5. **Verify**: Check against tool list (complete and correct)
6. **Stage**: Place in tool cart or case, deliver to machine
7. **Return After Job**: Tools back to crib, disassemble and inspect

**Tool Kitting Systems:**

**1. Tool Carts**

Rolling cart with tool holder slots:
- Holds complete tool set for a job
- Wheels to machine
- Labeled with job number
- Returns to crib when job complete

**2. Tool Cases**

Plastic or metal case (like a toolbox):
- Foam inserts for each tool
- Portable, protected
- Labeled with job number and tool list inside lid

**3. Tool Boards**

Pegboard or panel with hooks:
- Tools hang in sequence (T1, T2, T3, etc.)
- Visual—easy to see if tool missing
- Stays at machine during job

**When to Kit:**

- **High-mix, low-volume**: Frequent job changes → kit every job
- **Long-run production**: Same tools stay at machine → no kitting needed
- **Complex setups**: Many tools → kit to ensure completeness
- **Multi-machine jobs**: Same tools used on multiple machines → kit for efficiency

## 23.4.2 Tool Inventory Management

How much tool inventory should you carry? Too much ties up cash and takes space. Too little causes production delays.

### 23.4.2.1 Min/Max Systems

**Min/Max Inventory Control**: Simple, effective method

**Concept:**

- **Minimum (Min)**: Reorder point—when quantity drops to Min, order more
- **Maximum (Max)**: Target quantity after reorder arrives

**Example:**
- **1/2" 4-flute endmill**:
  - Min: 3 pieces
  - Max: 10 pieces
  - When inventory drops to 3, order 7 more (to bring back to 10)

**Setting Min/Max Levels:**

**Minimum = Safety Stock + Lead Time Demand**

**Safety Stock**: Buffer against variability
- Typical: 1-2 weeks usage
- Higher for critical tools or unreliable suppliers

**Lead Time Demand**: Usage during supplier lead time
- If supplier takes 1 week and you use 2/week → need 2 in lead time demand

**Example:**
- Usage: 2 endmills per week
- Lead time: 1 week
- Desired safety stock: 1 week
- Min = (2 × 1 week safety) + (2 × 1 week lead time) = 4 endmills

**Maximum = Min + Order Quantity**
- Order quantity based on economic order quantity (EOQ) or convenient pack size

**Visual Min/Max:**

Mark bins or drawers:
- Red line or tape at Min level ("reorder now")
- Green zone above Min ("OK")
- Max level marked (don't over-order)

Easy to see at a glance if reorder needed.

### 23.4.2.2 Kanban for Tools and Consumables

**Kanban**: Visual signal to replenish

**Two-Bin Kanban System:**

1. **Two bins** for each item (both hold enough for lead time + safety stock)
2. **Use from Bin A** until empty
3. **When Bin A empty**, place reorder card/signal
4. **Switch to Bin B** (while waiting for Bin A to be refilled)
5. **Bin A refilled**, becomes backup again

**Benefits:**
- Never run out (always have Bin B)
- Automatic reorder (no need to check inventory constantly)
- Visual (empty bin = signal to reorder)

**Kanban Card:**

Card placed with inventory, removed when reorder needed:
```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│  KANBAN CARD             │
│  Item: 1/2" 4Fl Endmill  │
│  Part #: B211A05000HP    │
│  Supplier: Kennametal    │
│  Order Qty: 10           │
│  Lead Time: 1 week       │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

When inventory reaches reorder point, card goes to purchasing.

**Electronic Kanban:**

Modern version:
- Scan barcode when last item taken
- Automatic notification to purchasing or supplier
- Supplier ships automatically (vendor-managed inventory)

### 23.4.2.3 Tool Usage Tracking

**Why Track Usage?**

- Forecast future needs
- Identify high-consumption tools (optimize inventory)
- Detect abnormal consumption (process problems)
- Cost accounting (tool cost per part)

**Tracking Methods:**

**1. Manual Logs**

Paper or spreadsheet:
- Date, part number, tool used, quantity
- Operator or setup person records
- Pros: Simple, low tech
- Cons: Easy to forget, data entry burden

**2. Checkout System**

Tool crib checkout (like library):
- Operator requests tool, crib attendant records
- Pros: Centralized, accurate
- Cons: Requires staffed tool crib

**3. Barcode/RFID Scanning**

Scan tool when issued:
- Automatic data capture
- Links to job/machine
- Pros: Accurate, minimal effort
- Cons: Requires equipment, setup

**4. Machine Monitoring Integration**

CNC machine reports tool usage:
- Track tool life counters
- Automatic when tool reaches life limit
- Pros: Real-time, integrated with tool life management
- Cons: Requires machine connectivity, software

**Using Usage Data:**

- **Forecast demand**: "We use 8 of these per month"
- **Optimize inventory**: "We never use this—reduce stock"
- **Identify problems**: "Sudden increase in usage—tool breaking prematurely?"
- **Cost analysis**: "This part costs $12 in tooling per piece"

## 23.4.3 Cutting Tool Life Management

Cutting tools wear and eventually need replacement. Managing tool life optimizes cost and quality.

### 23.4.3.1 Tool Life Data Collection

**Tool Life**: Number of parts (or time) tool can produce before needing replacement

**Affected by:**
- Material being cut (harder = shorter life)
- Cutting parameters (speed, feed, depth)
- Tool material and geometry
- Coolant effectiveness
- Machine condition

**Tracking Tool Life:**

**1. Cycle Counter**

Count parts produced with tool:
- Reset counter when tool replaced
- When counter reaches life limit, replace tool
- Simple, effective for consistent parts

**2. Time-Based**

Track hours of cutting:
- CNC control tracks spindle time
- When time reaches limit, replace tool
- Good for varying part types

**3. Measurement-Based**

Measure tool wear periodically:
- Flank wear, nose wear, diameter
- Replace when wear reaches limit
- Most accurate, but labor-intensive

**4. Breakage Detection**

Tool breaks → detected by:
- Load monitoring (sudden drop in cutting force)
- Acoustic emission (sound signature changes)
- Probe check after operation
- Prevents machining with broken tool (scrap)

**Recording Data:**

**Tool Life Log:**

| Tool ID | Part # | Initial Date | Parts Made | Replaced Date | Life (parts) | Notes |
|---------|--------|--------------|------------|---------------|--------------|-------|
| T02 1/2" EM | 12345 | 1/10/25 | 250 | 1/15/25 | 250 | Normal wear |
| T02 1/2" EM | 12345 | 1/15/25 | 180 | 1/18/25 | 180 | Chipped - coolant issue |

**Analysis:**
- Average life: 215 parts (if coolant issue resolved)
- Variability: Investigate why second tool lasted less

### 23.4.3.2 Predictive Tool Replacement

**Reactive Replacement**: Wait until tool breaks or part is bad
- **Problem**: Scrap parts, machine damage, downtime

**Preventive Replacement**: Replace at fixed interval (conservative)
- **Problem**: May replace tools with life remaining (waste)

**Predictive Replacement**: Replace based on actual condition
- **Optimal**: Maximize tool life without risking quality or breakage

**Predictive Methods:**

**1. Tool Life Data + Safety Factor**

- Establish average tool life (e.g., 250 parts)
- Replace at 80% of average (200 parts)
- Safety factor prevents unexpected failure
- Balance: Too conservative = waste, too aggressive = risk

**2. Real-Time Monitoring**

- Monitor cutting forces, vibration, temperature
- Detect gradual increase (wear) or sudden change (chipping)
- Replace when thresholds exceeded
- Requires sensors and software

**3. Periodic Inspection**

- Remove tool at intervals, inspect under microscope or optical comparator
- Measure wear (flank wear, crater wear)
- Return to service if acceptable, replace if near limit
- Manual but accurate

**4. Adaptive Control**

- CNC control adjusts feeds/speeds based on cutting force
- Tool wear increases force → control compensates
- When compensation limit reached, signal tool change
- Advanced, requires adaptive control feature

**Benefits:**
- Reduce scrap (replace before tool fails)
- Reduce cost (maximize tool life)
- Predictable (scheduled replacement, not emergency)

### 23.4.3.3 Tool Reconditioning Programs

**Reconditioning**: Restore worn tool to like-new condition

**Applicable Tools:**

- Solid carbide endmills and drills (regrind cutting edges)
- Indexable insert tools (replace inserts, clean holders)
- Reamers and taps (regrind if geometry allows)
- Special form tools (regrind, recoat)

**Not Practical:**
- Disposable inserts (cost of reconditioning > new insert)
- Small, inexpensive tools (e.g., $5 drill → not worth regrinding)

**Reconditioning Process:**

1. **Collect Worn Tools**: Designate bin for "dull" tools
2. **Send to Regrind Service** (or in-house if equipped)
3. **Inspect Reground Tools**: Verify geometry, edge quality
4. **Return to Inventory**: Marked as "reground" (track life)

**Economics:**

**Example: 1/2" Solid Carbide Endmill**
- New cost: $40
- Regrind cost: $12
- Usable regrinds: 3-4 times

**Total life value:**
- New tool: 250 parts × 4 regrinds = 1,000 parts
- Total cost: $40 + ($12 × 3) = $76
- Cost per part: $76 ÷ 1,000 = $0.076

vs. **Throw away after initial life:**
- Cost per 250 parts: $40
- Cost per part: $40 ÷ 250 = $0.16

**Reconditioning saves 53% on tool cost.**

**Tracking Regrinds:**

- Mark tool with regrind count (1R, 2R, 3R)
- Track life after each regrind
- Typically, life decreases slightly each regrind

**Quality Considerations:**

- Use reputable regrind service
- Inspect returned tools (some may be rejected if geometry off)
- Don't regrind critical finish tools (geometry precision required)

---

## 23.4.4 Tooling Standards and Rationalization

**Problem**: Tool proliferation—too many different tools

Example: 15 different 1/2" endmills from 5 manufacturers

**Issues:**
- Large inventory investment
- Confusion (which one to use?)
- Difficult to manage (min/max for 15 items vs. 3)
- Lost volume discounts (buying small quantities of many)

**Solution**: Tooling standardization and rationalization

### 23.4.4.1 Reducing Tool Variety

**Tool Rationalization Process:**

1. **Inventory Audit**: List all tools in stock
2. **Usage Analysis**: Which are actually used? (Many never touched)
3. **Categorize**:
   - **Active**: Used regularly
   - **Occasional**: Used sometimes
   - **Obsolete**: Not used, for discontinued parts
   - **Duplicate**: Same function, different brand/model

4. **Consolidate Duplicates**:
   - Choose one preferred tool for each application
   - Use up existing stock of others, don't reorder
   - Update programs to use standard tools

5. **Preferred Vendor**: Select 1-2 suppliers for each tool type
   - Negotiate volume pricing
   - Simplify ordering
   - Build relationship

**Example Results:**

**Before Rationalization:**
- 1/2" endmills: 15 different items, $12,000 inventory
- Order 2-3 of each as needed

**After Rationalization:**
- 1/2" endmills: 3 standard items (roughing, general, finishing)
- $4,000 inventory (67% reduction)
- Order 20 at a time, volume discount (10% savings)

**Cautions:**

- Don't eliminate specialized tools needed for critical apps
- Transition gradually (use up old stock)
- Communicate with programmers and operators (document standards)

### 23.4.4.2 Standard Tool Holders

**Tool Holder Proliferation**: Different holders for every tool

**Problems:**
- Large inventory of holders
- Long setup times (can't find right holder)
- Difficult to share tools between machines (different holders)

**Solution: Standardize holders**

**Strategies:**

**1. Modular Tooling Systems**

- Standard interface (e.g., Kennametal KM, Sandvik Coromant Capto)
- Cutting tools attach to standard shanks
- Shanks fit into standard holders
- Mix and match components

**Benefits:**
- Reduce holder inventory (fewer unique holders)
- Swap cutting tools quickly (change head, not entire assembly)
- Share tools across machines

**2. Standard Holder Lengths**

- Define standard gauge lengths (e.g., 4.000", 6.000", 8.000")
- All tools preset to these lengths
- Easier tool management (know offsets in advance)
- Faster setup (predictable)

**3. Standard Tool Holder Styles**

- Choose preferred styles (e.g., shrink fit, hydraulic, collet)
- Reduce variety
- Leverage supplier volume pricing

**Example:**

**Before:** 50 different holders (mix of ER collet, shrink fit, end mill holders)

**After:** Standardize on:
- Hydraulic holders: General purpose
- Shrink fit holders: High-performance/high-speed
- Face mill holders: Large cutters

Result: 20 holder types (60% reduction)

### 23.4.4.3 Modular Tooling Systems

**Modular Tooling**: Building block approach

**Concept:**
- Standard shanks (interfaces to machine)
- Interchangeable heads (cutting tools)
- Adaptors and extensions

**Example: Boring System**

Traditional: Separate boring bar for each diameter
- 1.0" bore → 1.0" boring bar
- 1.5" bore → 1.5" boring bar
- 2.0" bore → 2.0" boring bar

Modular: One shank, multiple heads
- Standard boring bar shank (fits machine)
- Interchangeable boring heads (1.0", 1.5", 2.0")
- Swap heads in seconds

**Benefits:**

1. **Reduced Inventory**: Fewer shanks, more heads (heads cheaper)
2. **Flexibility**: Reconfigure tools for different jobs
3. **Fast Changes**: Swap heads, not entire assemblies
4. **Cost Savings**: Don't buy complete tool for every size

**Common Modular Systems:**

- **Boring systems**: Single shank, multiple heads
- **Turning systems**: Tool holder + interchangeable cartridges
- **Milling systems**: Arbor + indexable cutter heads
- **Tap/drill systems**: Standard shank + quick-change chucks

**Considerations:**

- **Initial cost**: Modular systems can be expensive upfront
- **Compatibility**: Stay within one system (don't mix incompatible brands)
- **Training**: Operators and programmers must understand system

---

## 23.4.5 Tool Presetting and Measurement

**Tool Presetting**: Measuring tool dimensions before installing in machine

**Why Preset?**

1. **Faster Setup**: Offsets already known (no touch-off in machine)
2. **Accuracy**: Precise measurement off-machine
3. **Uptime**: Machine keeps running while tools prepared
4. **Consistency**: All tools measured with same method/equipment

### Tool Presetting Process

**1. Tool Preparation**

- Assemble tool (cutting tool + holder)
- Clean (no chips, dirt, or coolant)
- Verify cutting edge quality

**2. Measurement**

Use **tool presetter** (optical or laser measuring system):
- Measure tool length (from gage line to cutting edge)
- Measure tool diameter (for endmills, drills)
- Measure tool radius (for corner radius tools)
- Record values

**3. Documentation**

Record measurements:
- Tool ID number
- Length offset
- Diameter offset
- Date preset
- Operator who preset

**4. Transfer to Machine**

Enter offsets into CNC control:
- Manually type (small shops)
- Transfer via network or USB (larger shops)
- Automatic upload (tool management software)

**5. Verification** (Optional but Recommended)

Quick check in machine:
- Touch off on known surface (verify length)
- Run first part and inspect (verify program and offsets)

### Tool Presetter Equipment

**Manual Tool Presetters:**

- Optical comparator or microscope
- Measure tool against reticle or screen
- Operator records values manually
- **Cost**: $2,000-$10,000
- **Accuracy**: ±0.0005" typical

**Digital Tool Presetters:**

- Camera and measurement software
- Automatic edge detection
- Digital display and printout
- **Cost**: $10,000-$50,000
- **Accuracy**: ±0.0001" typical

**Laser Tool Presetters:**

- Laser scanning of tool geometry
- Very fast, automatic
- Measures complex geometries
- **Cost**: $50,000-$150,000+
- **Accuracy**: ±0.00005" typical

**Choosing a Presetter:**

| Shop Size | Volume | Recommended System |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| Small (1-3 machines) | Low | Manual optical presetter or touch-off in machine |
| Medium (5-10 machines) | Moderate | Digital presetter with camera |
| Large (10+ machines) | High | Laser presetter or multiple digital presetters |

**Benefits of Presetting:**

- **Save machine time**: 5-10 minutes per setup (machine runs while tools preset)
- **Accuracy**: Better than in-machine touch-off (operator skill variation eliminated)
- **Documentation**: Measured offsets recorded for future use
- **Troubleshooting**: If problem arises, verify tool offsets quickly

---

## 23.4.6 Tool Calibration and Inspection

**Tools Must Be Accurate**

- Worn tools produce bad parts
- Damaged tools cause quality issues
- Out-of-spec tools violate standards (AS9100, ISO 13485)

### Inspection Requirements

**1. Incoming Inspection**

New tools received:
- Visual inspection (damage in shipping?)
- Dimensional check (sample or 100%): Is diameter correct?
- Certification review (if applicable): Material certs, calibration certs

**2. In-Process Inspection**

Tools in use:
- Periodic checks during production
- Measure critical features (diameter, length)
- Detect wear before it causes bad parts

**3. Tool Reconditioning Inspection**

Reground tools:
- Verify geometry (diameter, length, edge prep)
- Inspect for cracks or damage
- Accept or reject

### Inspection Methods

**Diameter Measurement:**

- Micrometers (for larger tools)
- Pin gages or bore gages (for drills, reamers)
- Optical comparator (for complex tools)
- Tool presetter (integrated measurement)

**Length Measurement:**

- Height gage or tool presetter
- Measure from gage line to cutting edge

**Geometry Verification:**

- Optical comparator: Project tool profile, compare to drawing
- Profile projector: Magnified tool shape
- CMM: For very complex tools (expensive, rarely needed)

**Cutting Edge Inspection:**

- Visual (loupe or microscope): Chips, cracks, wear
- Run finger along edge (carefully!): Detect nicks or dullness

### Tool Calibration

**Do cutting tools need calibration?** (like gages?)

**Typically, no.** Cutting tools are consumable—they wear and are replaced.

**However:**

- **Tool presetters** need calibration (they're measuring devices)
- **Master tools** or **setting gages** need calibration (used to verify presetter accuracy)

**Presetter Calibration:**

- Use calibrated master tool (known length and diameter)
- Measure master on presetter
- Compare result to master's certified value
- If out of tolerance, adjust or repair presetter
- Frequency: Annually or per manufacturer recommendation

**Documentation:**

- Calibration certificate for presetter
- Traceability to NIST standards (if required by QMS)
