# Module 22 – Quality Management Systems (QMS)


Effective quality management depends on clear documentation that defines processes, procedures, and responsibilities. This section covers the essential documentation components of a QMS and how to create practical, usable documents for CNC manufacturing.

---

## 22.4.1 Quality Manual Development

The **Quality Manual** is the top-level document describing the organization's QMS. While ISO 9001:2015 doesn't explicitly require a quality manual, it remains a valuable tool for communicating the QMS structure.

### Purpose of Quality Manual

**Internal Use**:
- Provides overview of QMS for employees
- Reference for training new personnel
- Foundation for internal audits

**External Use**:
- Demonstrates QMS to customers
- Required by some customer contracts
- Supports certification audits
- Marketing tool (demonstrates commitment to quality)

### Quality Manual Structure

**Typical Quality Manual Contents**:

1. **Title Page and Revision Control**
   - Document title: "Quality Manual"
   - Company name and logo
   - Document number and revision level
   - Effective date
   - Approval signatures

2. **Table of Contents**

3. **Introduction and Company Overview**
   - Company history and background
   - Facilities and locations
   - Products and services
   - Markets served
   - Organizational structure

4. **Quality Policy**
   - Management's commitment to quality
   - Alignment with business strategy
   - Signed by top management

5. **Scope of QMS**
   - Products and services covered
   - Locations included
   - ISO 9001 clauses excluded (with justification)
   - Industry standards applicable (AS9100, ISO 13485, IATF 16949)

6. **Quality Management System**
   - Process approach overview
   - Process interactions (process map)
   - Risk-based thinking application
   - Documented information control

7. **Management Responsibility** (ISO 9001 Clause 5)
   - Leadership and commitment
   - Quality objectives
   - Roles, responsibilities, authorities
   - Management review process

8. **Resource Management** (ISO 9001 Clause 7)
   - Human resources (competence, training)
   - Infrastructure (facilities, equipment)
   - Work environment
   - Monitoring and measuring resources (calibration)

9. **Product Realization** (ISO 9001 Clause 8)
   - Operational planning
   - Customer requirements review
   - Design and development (if applicable)
   - Purchasing and supplier management
   - Production and service provision
   - Control of measuring equipment

10. **Measurement, Analysis, Improvement** (ISO 9001 Clause 9-10)
    - Monitoring and measurement
    - Customer satisfaction
    - Internal audits
    - Nonconforming product control
    - Corrective action
    - Continual improvement

11. **Document References**
    - List of procedures referenced in manual
    - Work instructions and forms
    - External documents (standards, regulations)

12. **Revision History**
    - Table of revisions with dates and descriptions of changes

### Quality Manual Content Approach

**Two Approaches**:

**1. Descriptive Approach** (Traditional):
- Detailed description of how each ISO 9001 clause is addressed
- Includes procedures within manual or detailed references
- Longer document (50-100+ pages)
- Advantage: Comprehensive, less need to reference other documents
- Disadvantage: Requires frequent updates when procedures change

**2. Reference Approach** (Modern):
- Brief description of QMS with references to procedures
- Focused on "what" not "how"
- Shorter document (20-40 pages)
- Advantage: Easier to maintain, procedures updated independently
- Disadvantage: Must reference multiple documents for full picture

**Example: Descriptive vs. Reference Approach**

*Descriptive Approach (detailed):*
> **8.6 Control of Measuring Equipment**
>
> All measuring equipment used for product verification is calibrated per the following process:
> 1. Quality Manager maintains master calibration schedule listing all equipment, calibration intervals, and due dates
> 2. Two weeks before due date, Quality Manager sends equipment to accredited calibration lab
> 3. Upon return, Quality Manager verifies calibration certificate received and results acceptable
> 4. Calibration sticker applied to equipment showing due date
> 5. Equipment returned to service and schedule updated
> 6. Records retained for 7 years
> 7. If equipment found out-of-tolerance, Quality Manager investigates impact on measurements since last calibration and notifies affected customers if necessary...

*Reference Approach (brief):*
> **8.6 Control of Measuring Equipment**
>
> Measuring equipment used for product verification is calibrated at specified intervals against traceable standards. Calibration procedures, intervals, and records are defined in Procedure QP-08 Calibration Control.

**Recommendation**: Use **reference approach** for flexibility and ease of maintenance.

### Quality Manual Approval and Control

**Approval**:
- Top management approval required (President, CEO, or General Manager signature)
- Quality Manager typically authors

**Revision Control**:
- Revision level tracked (Rev A, B, C or version numbers)
- Revision history page documents changes
- Current revision available to all personnel (intranet, shared drive, printed copies in binders)
- Obsolete revisions removed or marked "Obsolete"

**Example Revision History**:

| Revision | Date | Description of Changes | Approved By |
|----------|------|------------------------|-------------|
| A | 2020-01-15 | Initial release | J. Smith, President |
| B | 2021-06-22 | Updated Clause 8.4 supplier management process | J. Smith, President |
| C | 2023-09-10 | Updated for ISO 9001:2015, added AS9100 scope | J. Smith, President |

## 22.4.2 Process Documentation and Procedures

Procedures document **how** processes are performed, providing consistency and ensuring requirements are met.

### Documentation Hierarchy

```
Level 1: Quality Manual (QMS overview, policy, scope)
           ↓
Level 2: Procedures (process-level "how-to")
           ↓
Level 3: Work Instructions (detailed task steps)
           ↓
Level 4: Records (evidence of conformance)
```

### 22.4.2.1 Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

**Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)**: Documented method describing how to perform a process or activity.

#### When SOPs Are Needed

**ISO 9001 Required Procedures** (not explicitly called out, but typically documented as procedures):
- Document control
- Control of records
- Internal audits
- Control of nonconforming product
- Corrective action
- Preventive action (often combined with corrective action)

**Additional Procedures** (organization determines need):
- Management review
- Training and competence
- Calibration control
- Purchasing and supplier management
- Production planning
- Inspection and testing
- Customer complaint handling
- Continuous improvement

**CNC Shop Common SOPs**:
- Job setup approval and first-off inspection
- In-process inspection
- Final inspection and release
- NC program verification and approval
- Tool life management
- Preventive maintenance
- Coolant management
- Customer property control

#### SOP Format and Structure

**Typical SOP Sections**:

1. **Header**:
   - Procedure title
   - Procedure number
   - Revision level and date
   - Page numbers (Page X of Y)

2. **Purpose**:
   - Why procedure exists
   - What it aims to achieve

3. **Scope**:
   - Where procedure applies
   - What's included/excluded

4. **Definitions** (if needed):
   - Terms specific to procedure

5. **Responsibilities**:
   - Who does what (roles)

6. **Procedure Steps**:
   - Sequential steps to perform process
   - Detailed enough for competent person to follow

7. **Records**:
   - Forms and records generated
   - Retention requirements

8. **References**:
   - Related procedures, work instructions, standards

9. **Approval and Revision History**:
   - Who approved
   - Revision history table

#### SOP Writing Best Practices

**1. Use Clear, Concise Language**:
- Short sentences
- Active voice ("Inspect the part" not "The part is inspected")
- Simple words (avoid jargon unless defined)

**2. Use Numbered Steps**:
- Sequential numbering (1, 2, 3...)
- Sub-steps if needed (1.1, 1.2...)

**3. Be Specific**:
- Use exact terminology ("Measure diameter with 0-1" micrometer" not "Check size")
- Specify acceptance criteria ("Diameter must be .500±.002" not "Diameter must be in tolerance")

**4. Use Visual Aids**:
- Flowcharts for complex decision trees
- Photos of equipment or setup
- Tables for data or acceptance criteria

**5. Keep It Practical**:
- Write for the user (operator, inspector, programmer)
- Test procedure with actual user
- Avoid unnecessary complexity

**Example SOP Excerpt**: **Procedure QP-15: First-Off Inspection**

> **Purpose**: To verify setup correctness before production run, preventing production of nonconforming parts.
>
> **Scope**: Applies to all CNC machining operations.
>
> **Responsibilities**:
> - **Operator**: Machines first-off part, performs visual and basic checks
> - **Inspector**: Performs dimensional inspection, approves or rejects setup
> - **Supervisor**: Reviews and approves setup documentation
>
> **Procedure**:
> 1. Operator completes machine setup per setup sheet
> 2. Operator runs first part (first-off)
> 3. Operator performs visual inspection:
>    - Check for burrs, sharp edges
>    - Verify all operations completed
>    - Check for obvious errors (missing holes, wrong material)
> 4. Operator delivers first-off part and traveler to Inspection
> 5. Inspector retrieves applicable drawing and control plan
> 6. Inspector measures all dimensions listed on control plan
> 7. Inspector records results on traveler in "First-Off Inspection" section
> 8. If all dimensions within tolerance:
>    - Inspector stamps "APPROVED" on traveler
>    - Inspector returns traveler to operator
>    - Operator proceeds with production
> 9. If any dimension out of tolerance:
>    - Inspector stamps "REJECTED" on traveler
>    - Inspector notifies operator and supervisor
>    - Operator adjusts setup and repeats process (Step 2)
> 10. Supervisor reviews and signs traveler upon approval
>
> **Records**: Traveler with first-off inspection results (retained with job jacket)

### 22.4.2.2 Work Instructions

**Work Instruction (WI)**: Detailed, step-by-step instructions for performing specific task or operation.

#### Work Instructions vs. Procedures

| Aspect | Procedure (SOP) | Work Instruction (WI) |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Level | Process-level (multiple tasks) | Task-level (single operation) |
| Detail | General steps | Detailed, granular steps |
| Scope | Broad (applies to process) | Narrow (applies to specific task) |
| Audience | Anyone performing process | Specific operator or technician |
| Example | "Inspection and Testing Procedure" | "Inspecting Shaft Diameter with Micrometer" |

#### When Work Instructions Are Needed

**Work Instructions Recommended For**:
- Complex operations requiring many steps
- Operations where mistakes are costly (expensive parts, safety-critical)
- Operations prone to errors (history of nonconformances)
- Operations requiring special skills or knowledge
- Training new employees
- Regulatory requirements (FDA, AS9100)

**Not Every Task Needs WI**:
- Competent personnel with training may not need WI for routine tasks
- Overly detailed WIs become burdensome and ignored
- Balance: Provide WIs where value added

**CNC Shop Work Instructions Examples**:
- CMM inspection for complex features
- Heat treatment furnace operation
- Passivation process for stainless steel
- Welding procedure for specific joint configuration
- Plating tank operation and monitoring
- Leak testing procedure for pressure vessels

#### Work Instruction Format

**Visual Work Instructions** (preferred for shop floor):
- Heavy use of photos, diagrams, illustrations
- Minimal text (bullet points, short sentences)
- Large font for readability
- Laminated or in protective sleeve (shop environment)

**Example Visual WI Structure**:

## 22.4.3 Document Control Systems

**Document Control** ensures that current, approved documents are available where needed and obsolete documents are removed.

### Document Control Requirements (ISO 9001 Clause 7.5.3)

**Documented Information Must Be**:
- **Available** where and when needed
- **Adequately protected** (confidentiality, integrity, loss prevention)

**Document Control Includes**:
- Distribution and access control
- Identification (version, revision)
- Review and approval
- Update and revision control
- Removal of obsolete documents

### 22.4.3.1 Document Revision and Version Control

#### Revision Numbering Systems

**Letter-Based System**:
- Initial release: Rev A
- Subsequent revisions: Rev B, C, D, E, etc.
- After Rev Z, can use AA, AB, or restart at A with number suffix (A1, A2)

**Number-Based System**:
- Initial release: Rev 1 or 1.0
- Subsequent revisions: Rev 2, 3, 4... or 1.1, 1.2, 2.0, etc.
- Decimal for minor changes (1.1, 1.2), whole number for major (2.0)

**Hybrid System**:
- Major revisions: Letter (A, B, C)
- Minor edits within revision: Number (A1, A2, B1)

**Engineering Drawing Revisions** (industry standard):
- Numeric: 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. (sometimes -0, -1, -2)
- Alpha: A, B, C, etc.
- Revision block on drawing lists changes

**Recommendation**: Be consistent throughout QMS. Most shops use **letter-based (Rev A, B, C)** for procedures and drawings.

#### Revision History

**Revision History Table** (included in each procedure/manual):

| Revision | Date | Description of Changes | Approved By |
|----------|------|------------------------|-------------|
| A | 2020-01-15 | Initial release | Q. Manager |
| B | 2021-06-22 | Updated Step 5.3, added Form QF-12 | Q. Manager |
| C | 2023-09-10 | Revised responsibilities section, reformatted | Q. Manager |

**Purpose**:
- Traceability of changes
- Understanding what changed between revisions
- Audit trail for compliance

#### Change Control Process

**Document Change Process**:

1. **Change Request**:
   - Anyone can request change (improvement, correction, clarification)
   - Submit request to Document Control or Quality Manager

2. **Review**:
   - Document owner reviews request
   - Determine if change warranted
   - Draft revised document

3. **Approval**:
   - Same authority that approved original (Quality Manager, Department Manager, Top Management)
   - Signature or electronic approval

4. **Distribution**:
   - New revision distributed to all holders of document
   - Notification sent (email, document control log)

5. **Removal of Obsolete**:
   - Retrieve old revision (if paper copies)
   - Mark obsolete or destroy
   - Update master list

6. **Training** (if significant change):
   - Train affected personnel on changes
   - Document training

### 22.4.3.2 Document Distribution and Access

#### Master Document List

**Master List**: Register of all controlled documents

**Master List Contents**:
- Document number
- Document title
- Current revision level
- Date of current revision
- Location (physical or electronic)
- Distribution list (who has copy)

**Example Master Document List**:

| Doc Number | Title | Current Rev | Rev Date | Location | Distribution |
|------------|-------|-------------|----------|----------|--------------|
| QM-01 | Quality Manual | C | 2023-09-10 | Server/QMS | All employees (intranet) |
| QP-01 | Document Control | B | 2021-03-15 | Server/QMS | Document Control |
| QP-08 | Calibration Control | A | 2020-05-20 | Server/QMS | Quality Dept |
| WI-105 | Micrometer Use | B | 2022-08-12 | Server/QMS | Inspection Dept |

#### Distribution Methods

**Electronic Distribution** (modern, preferred):
- **Intranet / SharePoint**: Central repository, accessible by all employees
- **Shared Network Drive**: Folder structure with permissions
- **Document Management Software**: Dedicated QMS software (MasterControl, ETQ, etc.)
- **Advantages**: Always current revision, instant updates, searchable, no paper
- **Controls**: Read-only access (prevent unauthorized changes), backup and security

**Paper Distribution** (traditional, less common now):
- **Controlled Copies**: Numbered copies (Copy 1, Copy 2, etc.) distributed to specific locations
- **Stamp**: "CONTROLLED COPY" stamp on each page
- **Distribution Log**: Track who has which copy
- **Updates**: Retrieve old revision, replace with new
- **Disadvantages**: Labor-intensive, risk of obsolete copies in circulation, not eco-friendly

**Uncontrolled Copies**:
- Stamped "UNCONTROLLED COPY" or "FOR REFERENCE ONLY"
- Used for temporary reference, training, audits (auditor copies)
- No guarantee of current revision
- Not suitable for production use

**Best Practice**: Use **electronic distribution** with read-only access and automatic version control (document management system or SharePoint with versioning enabled).

#### Access Control

**Who Needs Access?**:
- **All employees**: Quality Manual, Quality Policy, relevant procedures
- **Specific departments**: Procedures and work instructions applicable to their work
- **External parties**: May need controlled access to certain documents (e.g., suppliers to purchase specs)

**Permissions**:
- **Read-Only**: Most users (view only, cannot edit)
- **Edit**: Document owners (Quality Manager, Process Owners)
- **Approve**: Management (Quality Manager, Department Heads, Top Management)

**Confidentiality**:
- Some documents may be confidential (proprietary processes, customer data, pricing)
- Restrict access as appropriate
- Label confidential documents

### 22.4.3.3 Obsolete Document Management

**Why Control Obsolete Documents?**:
- Prevent unintended use (producing parts to old revision of drawing)
- Compliance requirement (ISO 9001)
- Reduce confusion

**Obsolete Document Process**:

**1. Identify Obsolete**:
- When new revision issued, previous revision becomes obsolete
- When document cancelled or replaced

**2. Remove from Use**:
- Electronic: Move to "Obsolete" or "Archive" folder, remove from active directory
- Paper: Retrieve from work areas, stamp "OBSOLETE", file separately or destroy

**3. Retention** (if required):
- Some obsolete documents must be retained for reference (traceability, legal, customer contract)
- Mark clearly as "OBSOLETE – FOR REFERENCE ONLY"
- Store separately from current documents

**4. Update Master List**:
- Indicate document obsolete or superseded
- Reference to replacement document

**Example**:
- Drawing 1234 Rev B superseded by Rev C
- Rev B drawing removed from production area
- Rev B retained in "Obsolete Drawings" archive for 7 years (traceability for parts made to Rev B)
- Stamped "OBSOLETE – DO NOT USE FOR NEW PRODUCTION"

---

## 22.4.5 Control Plans and Inspection Plans

**Control Plan**: Living document describing the systems and processes required to control the product and process.

### Control Plan Purpose

**Control Plans**:
- Define what characteristics to measure/monitor
- Specify how and when to measure
- Establish acceptance criteria
- Assign responsibility
- Guide production and inspection personnel

**Used Throughout Product Lifecycle**:
- **Prototype Control Plan**: During design and development
- **Pre-Launch Control Plan**: During pilot production
- **Production Control Plan**: During full production

### Control Plan Format

**Typical Control Plan Columns**:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Part Number/Name | Product identification |
| Process/Operation | Manufacturing step (setup, machining, inspection, etc.) |
| Characteristic | What is being controlled (dimension, visual, function) |
| Specification/Tolerance | Acceptance criteria (drawing requirement) |
| Evaluation Method | How measured (micrometer, gage, CMM, visual) |
| Sample Size/Frequency | How many parts, how often |
| Control Method | SPC chart, 100% inspection, sampling plan |
| Reaction Plan | What to do if out of spec (stop production, notify supervisor, adjust, etc.) |
| Responsible | Who performs control (operator, inspector) |

**Control Plan Example**: **Machined Shaft**

| Operation | Characteristic | Spec/Tolerance | Evaluation Method | Sample Size/Frequency | Control Method | Reaction Plan | Responsible |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| Setup | First-off approval | All dims per drawing | Per control plan | First piece | 100% | Stop production until approved | Operator + Inspector |
| Machining Op 1 | Diameter Ø.500±.002" | .498-.502" | Micrometer | 1 pc/hour | X-bar/R chart (SPC) | Adjust offset if trending | Operator |
| Machining Op 1 | Length 4.000±.010" | 3.990-4.010" | Calipers | 1 pc/4 hours | Record on log | Notify supervisor if out | Operator |
| Machining Op 2 | Surface finish | 63 Ra max | Visual + occasional profilometer | Visual 100%, profilometer 1/day | Visual comparison to standard | Adjust speed/feed if rough | Operator |
| Final Inspection | All dimensions | Per drawing | CMM | Per sampling plan (AQL) | Inspection report | Reject lot if multiple fails | Inspector |
| Final Inspection | Visual defects | No burrs, scratches, damage | Visual | 100% | Accept/reject | Rework or scrap | Inspector |

### Control Plan Development

**Steps to Create Control Plan**:

1. **Identify Characteristics**:
   - All dimensions and requirements from drawing
   - Critical characteristics (affecting fit, function, safety)
   - Special characteristics (customer-designated)

2. **Classify Characteristics**:
   - **Critical**: Affects safety or regulatory compliance (100% inspection or tight controls)
   - **Key/Major**: Affects fit, function, or customer satisfaction (controlled with SPC or sampling)
   - **Minor**: Other dimensions (periodic checks or sampling)

3. **Determine Evaluation Methods**:
   - Select appropriate measurement tools and techniques
   - Ensure measurement systems adequate (MSA performed)

4. **Establish Sample Size and Frequency**:
   - Balance risk, cost, and practicality
   - Critical: More frequent or 100%
   - Stable process with high Cpk: Less frequent

5. **Define Reaction Plans**:
   - Clear instructions for out-of-spec conditions
   - Escalation path (operator → supervisor → quality manager)

6. **Review and Approve**:
   - Engineering, Quality, Production review
   - Customer approval if required

**Control Plan as Living Document**:
- Update when process changes
- Revise based on capability studies (reduce inspection if Cpk improves)
- Incorporate lessons learned (increase inspection if problems arise)

### Inspection Plans

**Inspection Plan**: Subset of control plan focused on inspection activities

**Inspection Plan Contents**:
- What to inspect (characteristics)
- When to inspect (receiving, in-process, final)
- How to inspect (method, equipment)
- Acceptance criteria
- Records to maintain

**Difference from Control Plan**:
- Control plan covers entire manufacturing process (production + inspection)
- Inspection plan focuses only on inspection activities
- Some organizations use one document (control plan including inspection); others separate

**Example Inspection Plan Sections**:

**Receiving Inspection**:
- Material verification (certifications, markings)
- Dimensional checks (diameter, length of stock)
- Visual inspection (damage, corrosion)

**In-Process Inspection**:
- First-off inspection (setup approval)
- In-process checks (dimensions, visual)

**Final Inspection**:
- Dimensional inspection (all characteristics or sampling)
- Functional testing (if applicable)
- Visual inspection (cleanliness, appearance)
- Documentation review (travelers, certifications)

**Release Criteria**:
- All inspections passed
- Records complete
- Approvals obtained

## Summary

Quality planning and documentation form the foundation of an effective QMS. The quality manual provides an overview, procedures document processes, work instructions detail tasks, and forms capture evidence. Document control ensures the right documents are available and current. Control plans guide production and inspection, ensuring consistent quality.

Well-designed documentation is clear, practical, and usable by the intended audience. It balances thoroughness with simplicity, providing enough detail without becoming burdensome. In CNC manufacturing, effective documentation supports consistent processes, reduces errors, facilitates training, and provides evidence of conformance to customers and auditors.

2. **Documentation hierarchy**: Manual → Procedures → Work Instructions → Records
3. **Procedures (SOPs)** document "how" processes performed; should be clear, concise, and practical
4. **Work Instructions** provide detailed task-level steps; visual format preferred for shop floor
5. **Forms and records** capture evidence of conformance; design for usability and data capture
6. **Document control** ensures current documents available and obsolete removed; electronic distribution preferred
7. **Revision control** tracks changes; use consistent numbering system (Rev A, B, C, etc.)
8. **Master document list** maintains inventory of controlled documents and revisions
9. **Quality Plans** specify requirements for particular product or project; used for complex or high-risk items
10. **Control Plans** define characteristics to monitor, measurement methods, frequencies, and reaction plans
11. **Inspection Plans** detail what, when, and how to inspect
12. **Control Plans are living documents** updated based on process performance and lessons learned
