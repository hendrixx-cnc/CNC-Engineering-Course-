Re-calibration:
- Annually or after accuracy degrades
- After mechanical repairs or adjustments

- Example: Replace belt every 1 million cycles

**Failure Mode Analysis**

- Prioritize maintenance on weak points
- Stock critical spare parts

## Spare Parts Recommendations

**Critical Spares (Keep on Hand)**
