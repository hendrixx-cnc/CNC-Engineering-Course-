# Module 2 – Vertical Axis & Z-Stage


## Overview

Linear guides for vertical axes must address unique challenges beyond horizontal applications: gravitational preload, unequal loading on carriages, potential for binding under moment loads, and safety requirements for power-loss conditions. This section covers selection, sizing, and installation of linear guides optimized for Z-axis performance.

## Gravitational Loading Effects

### Constant Preload from Weight

Vertical guides experience continuous loading from moving mass weight:

**Load per carriage (4 carriages typical):**

$$F_{carriage} = \frac{m \times g}{n}$$

Where:
- m = moving mass (kg)
- g = 9.81 m/s²
- n = number of carriages (typically 4)

**Example:**
- Moving mass: 12 kg
- Load per carriage: 12 × 9.81 / 4 = 29.4 N

**Implications:**
- Minimum preload must exceed gravitational load
- Lower carriages carry slightly more load (column deflection)
- Preload selection more critical than horizontal axes

### Moment Loading

Off-center masses create moment loads:

$$M = F_{tool} \times d_{offset}$$

Moment distributes unequally across carriage pairs, potentially overloading one side.

## Rail Selection for Vertical Axes

### Size Selection

**Dynamic load capacity must account for:**
1. Gravitational constant load
2. Acceleration forces
3. Cutting forces
4. Safety factor (2-3× for vertical)

**Basic load rating:**

$$C_{required} = P \times \left(\frac{L_{design}}{L_{rating}}\right)^{1/3}$$

Vertical applications typically require one size larger than horizontal equivalent.

### Preload Selection

**Preload classes (HIWIN nomenclature):**
- **Z0**: Light preload (smallest clearance)
- **ZA**: Light-medium preload
- **ZB**: Medium preload (most common for vertical)
- **ZC**: Heavy preload (high-precision, rigid mounting)

**Recommendation for Z-axis:**
- Small machines (<10kg moving): ZA or ZB
- Medium machines (10-25kg): ZB or ZC
- Large machines (>25kg): ZC

Higher preload provides:
- Better rigidity under moment loads
- Reduced play and vibration
- Increased friction (counterbalance helps overcome)

### Rail Pair Configuration

**Single pair (not recommended):**
- Adequate for light loads only
- Poor moment resistance
- Risk of binding

**Dual pairs (standard):**
- Two rails, four carriages total
- Good moment capacity
- Spacing: 80-150mm typical

**Multiple pairs (heavy-duty):**
- Three+ rails for very heavy spindles
- Distributed loading
- Complex alignment requirements

## Installation and Alignment

### Rail Mounting

**Surface preparation:**
- Flatness: 10-20 µm over rail length
- Parallelism between rails: <20 µm
- Surface finish: Ra 1.6 µm

**Mounting procedure:**
1. Clean mounting surface and rail bottom
2. Apply thin layer of way oil
3. Position rail with dowel pins (if provided)
4. Tighten mounting screws progressively from center outward
5. Torque to specification (typically 6-8 N·m for M5, 12-15 N·m for M6)

### Carriage Alignment

**Vertical orientation:**
- All four carriages must align on single plane
- Misalignment causes binding and accelerated wear
- Use precision spacers during assembly

**Checking alignment:**
1. Install carriages on rails
2. Bolt to carriage plate with torque
3. Check smooth motion by hand over full travel
4. Any binding indicates misalignment—shim as needed

## Safety Considerations

### Brake Integration

Vertical axes require mechanical brakes for safety:

**Mounting options:**
1. Motor-integrated brake (most common)
2. Separate brake on ball screw
3. Friction brake on carriage (backup)

**Brake sizing:**
- Must hold 1.5× maximum moving mass
- Engage time: <100ms typical
- Spring-applied, electrically released (fail-safe)

### Anti-Drop Mechanisms

**Mechanical locks:**
- Spring-loaded pawl engages rack on power loss
- Manual release for maintenance
- Common on large machines

**Counterbalance as safety:**
- Properly balanced system prevents rapid descent
- Not sufficient as sole safety mechanism
- Use with brake for redundancy

## Key Takeaways

1. **Vertical guides** require higher preload and larger sizes than horizontal equivalents
2. **Gravitational loading** is continuous and must be included in capacity calculations
3. **Moment loads** from off-center masses require proper carriage spacing
4. **Alignment** is critical—poor alignment causes binding and premature failure
5. **Mechanical brakes** are mandatory safety devices for vertical axes
6. **Dual-pair configuration** (4 carriages) is standard for most applications
7. **Preload class ZB or ZC** recommended for vertical mounting
8. **Anti-drop mechanisms** provide additional safety layers
