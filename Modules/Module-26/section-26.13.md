# Module 26 – CNC Business Ownership and Management

## Section 26.13 – Customer Relationship Management

### Overview

Customer relationships are the lifeblood of any CNC machine shop. While technical excellence and competitive pricing are important, the quality of your customer relationships often determines long-term success. This section explores how to build, maintain, and optimize customer relationships to create sustainable business growth.

According to research by Frederick Reichheld of Bain & Company, increasing customer retention rates by just 5% can increase profits by 25% to 95%. For manufacturing businesses, acquiring a new customer costs 5-7 times more than retaining an existing one. Furthermore, loyal customers tend to:
- Place larger orders over time
- Provide more consistent revenue
- Refer new business
- Be less price-sensitive
- Require less service overhead

However, not all customer relationships are equally valuable. Understanding how to identify, nurture, and occasionally end customer relationships is critical to building a profitable and sustainable business.

## 13.1 Understanding Customer Needs

### Beyond the Drawing

Many machine shops make the mistake of treating each job as a simple transaction: customer provides a drawing, shop makes the part, everyone moves on. Successful shops dig deeper to understand the true customer need.

**The Real Need May Not Be What's on the Drawing:**

When a customer requests a part, consider these deeper questions:

**Functional Requirements:**
- What problem is this part solving?
- What happens if this part fails?
- What are the critical features vs. nice-to-have features?
- Are there alternative approaches to achieve the same function?
- What are the actual tolerance requirements (not just what's on the print)?

**Business Context:**
- Is this for a prototype, production run, or emergency replacement?
- What's the customer's timeline and why?
- What's their budget constraint?
- What downstream processes are involved (assembly, finishing, testing)?
- Who is their end customer?

**Relationship Context:**
- Is this a test order or ongoing relationship potential?
- What are their pain points with current suppliers?
- What do they value most (price, quality, speed, service)?
- What's their decision-making process?
- Who are the influencers and decision-makers?

### Discovery Conversation Framework

**Initial Contact Questions:**

When a new customer contacts you, use these questions to understand their needs:

1. **"Tell me about what you're making and why you need these parts."**
   - Understand the bigger picture
   - Shows you care beyond the transaction
   - May reveal opportunities for value-add

2. **"What's your timeline and what's driving that schedule?"**
   - Understand urgency and flexibility
   - Reveals whether rush charges are justified
   - May indicate if schedule is realistic

3. **"What problems have you had with parts like this in the past?"**
   - Learn from others' mistakes
   - Understand quality concerns
   - Opportunity to differentiate

4. **"What's most important to you: price, delivery speed, or quality, and why?"**
   - Forces prioritization
   - Sets expectations
   - Guides your proposal

5. **"Are you looking for a one-time supplier or a long-term manufacturing partner?"**
   - Determines relationship investment level
   - Affects pricing strategy
   - Influences capacity planning

6. **"What would make this a successful project from your perspective?"**
   - Defines success criteria beyond the print
   - Uncovers unstated expectations
   - Provides framework for delivery

### Customer Segmentation

Not all customers are the same. Segment your customer base to allocate resources appropriately:

**A-Customers (Top 20% by Value):**
- Characteristics: High volume, regular orders, profitable, easy to work with, growth potential
- Management Approach:
  - Dedicated account management
  - Proactive communication
  - Priority scheduling
  - Volume discounts
  - Long-term contracts
  - Regular business reviews
  - Investment in custom tooling/fixtures

**B-Customers (Next 30%):**
- Characteristics: Moderate volume, periodic orders, reasonable profitability
- Management Approach:
  - Standard service level
  - Responsive communication
  - Normal scheduling
  - Competitive pricing
  - Opportunity for growth to A-status

**C-Customers (Bottom 50%):**
- Characteristics: Small orders, infrequent, price-focused, higher service demands
- Management Approach:
  - Efficient transaction processing
  - Standard communication
  - Batch with similar jobs
  - Full-price or surcharges for small lots
  - Automated systems where possible

**Problem Customers:**
- Characteristics: Unprofitable, excessive demands, late payments, unreasonable expectations
- Management Approach:
  - Price to profitability or exit
  - Document everything
  - Consider termination

### Understanding Industry-Specific Needs

Different industries have different priorities and cultures:

**Aerospace:**
- Priority: Quality, traceability, compliance
- Timeline: Long lead times acceptable

**Repair/Emergency:**
- Priority: Speed, availability, problem-solving
- Timeline: Immediate (hours to days)
- Pricing: Willing to pay premium for urgency
- Communication: Direct, 24/7 access
- Relationship: Need-based, but loyalty to reliable suppliers

## 13.2 Communication Best Practices

### Responsiveness Standards

**Speed of Response Matters:**

Research shows that responding to inquiries within 1 hour results in 7x higher qualification rates than waiting even 1 more hour. For machine shops:

**Quote Requests:**
- Acknowledge receipt: Within 2 hours during business hours
- Simple quotes: Within 24 hours
- Complex quotes: Within 48-72 hours (with timeline update)
- Rush quote requests: Within 4 hours (with premium pricing)

**Production Updates:**
- Weekly updates for long-term projects
- Daily updates when within 3 days of deadline
- Immediate notification of any issues or delays
- Proactive communication (don't make customers ask)

**Problem Resolution:**
- Acknowledge issue: Within 1 hour
- Initial assessment and plan: Within 4 hours
- Resolution or regular updates: Until resolved

**General Inquiries:**
- Email: Within 4 hours during business hours
- Phone: Answer live or return call within 2 hours
- After-hours: Next business day unless emergency

### Communication Methods by Purpose

**Email:**
- Best for: Formal communications, documentation, detailed quotes, non-urgent updates
- Advantages: Creates paper trail, allows time for thoughtful response, can include attachments
- Disadvantages: Can be ignored, lacks urgency, tone can be misinterpreted
- Best practices:
  - Clear subject lines
  - Brief and organized (use bullets)
  - Include next steps/action items
  - Professional tone but personable

**Phone:**
- Best for: Urgent issues, complex discussions, relationship building, bad news
- Advantages: Real-time, builds relationship, nuance and tone clear, faster resolution
- Disadvantages: No automatic record, requires scheduling, can be disruptive
- Best practices:
  - Follow up complex calls with email summary
  - Take notes during call
  - Confirm understanding before ending
  - Set next contact point

**Text/SMS:**
- Best for: Quick updates, delivery notifications, schedule confirmations
- Advantages: Immediate, high open rate, convenient
- Disadvantages: Informal, not suitable for complex information, no detail
- Best practices:
  - Get permission first
  - Keep brief
  - Use for logistics, not quotes or problem-solving
  - Professional language

**In-Person/Video Calls:**
- Best for: Major accounts, complex projects, problem resolution, relationship development
- Advantages: Strongest relationship building, full communication (body language), collaborative problem-solving
- Disadvantages: Time-intensive, requires scheduling, geographic limitations
- Best practices:
  - Schedule with agenda
  - Follow up with written summary
  - Use for high-value relationships
  - Facility tours for key customers

**Customer Portal/Automated Systems:**
- Best for: Order status, invoice access, repeat orders, standard communication
- Advantages: 24/7 access, reduces communication overhead, professional appearance
- Disadvantages: Impersonal, requires setup and maintenance, not all customers adopt
- Best practices:
  - Keep information current
  - Combine with personal touchpoints
  - Train customers on use
  - Monitor for issues

### Clear and Professional Communication

**Quote Presentations:**

A professional quote should include:

### Setting Communication Expectations

**During Onboarding:**

When starting a new customer relationship, establish communication norms:

"Here's how we typically work with our customers:
- Quote turnaround: 24-48 hours for standard work
- Order confirmation: Within 4 hours of PO receipt
- Production updates: Weekly via email, or you can call anytime for status
- Delivery: We'll notify you when parts ship with tracking info
- Issues: We'll contact you immediately if any concerns arise
- Preferred contact: What's the best way to reach you?"

**Documenting Preferences:**

In your CRM or customer file, note:
- Preferred communication method
- Best time to contact
- Decision makers vs. day-to-day contacts
- Communication frequency preference
- Special requirements or sensitivities

## 13.3 Managing Customer Expectations

### Lead Times and Delivery Promises

**The Under-Promise, Over-Deliver Principle:**

One of the most common mistakes in customer relationship management is over-promising and under-delivering on timelines.

**Best Practice:**
- Quote realistic lead time + 20% buffer
- Communicate early if ahead of schedule
- Build reputation for reliability

**Example:**
- Internal target: Complete by June 20
- Quote to customer: Deliver by June 25
- Actual delivery: June 22 (customer delighted by early delivery)

vs.

**Common Mistake:**
- Internal target: Complete by June 20
- Quote to customer: Deliver by June 18 (trying to win job)
- Actual delivery: June 23 (customer angry about late delivery)

In the second scenario, even though you delivered earlier than the realistic target, the customer is upset because you missed your commitment.

**Lead Time Communication:**

Be specific about what's included in your lead time:
- "2 weeks" is vague and leads to disappointment
- "10 business days from PO receipt and payment" is clear
- "Ships by June 25th via UPS Ground (typically 2-3 days to your location)" is even better

**Managing Rush Requests:**

When customers request rush delivery:

**Option 1: Accept with premium pricing**
"Normal lead time is 2 weeks. I can prioritize this and deliver in 1 week for an additional 30% rush charge. Would you like me to quote it both ways?"

**Option 2: Accept if genuinely possible**
"Let me check my schedule... I have an opening this week, so I can accommodate your timeline at standard pricing this time. For future orders, our standard lead time is 2 weeks."

**Option 3: Decline professionally**
"I understand the urgency. Unfortunately, my schedule is fully committed for the next two weeks. I could deliver in 3 weeks, or I can refer you to another shop that might have capacity sooner. What would be most helpful?"

**Never:**
- Agree to unrealistic timeline you can't meet
- Let customer pressure you into commitment you'll regret
- Sacrifice quality to meet unrealistic deadline

### Pricing and Change Management

**Upfront Pricing Transparency:**

Prevent pricing disputes by clear communication:

**Quote Stage:**
- "This quote is based on the drawing revision C dated 6/14/24"
- "Price assumes customer-supplied material to specification"
- "Any changes to quantity, specification, or drawing will require re-quote"
- "Quote valid for 30 days"

**Change Orders:**

When customer requests changes after order:

```
Change Order Request

Original Order:
- Part: ABC-12345 Rev C
- Quantity: 50
- Price: $2,125.00
- Delivery: June 25

Requested Change:
- Update to Rev D (added two tapped holes)

Impact Analysis:
- Additional programming: $75
- Additional operation: $3.50/piece x 50 = $175
- Schedule impact: 2-day delay

Revised Terms:
- Part: ABC-12345 Rev D
- Quantity: 50
- Price: $2,375.00 (+$250)
- Delivery: June 27 (+2 days)

Customer Approval Required:
□ Approve change as quoted
□ Decline change, proceed with original
□ Discuss alternatives

Signature: _____________ Date: _________
```

**Price Increase Communication:**

When you need to raise prices:

**Wrong Approach:**
"Due to increased costs, all prices are going up 15% effective immediately."

**Better Approach:**
```
Dear [Customer],

I wanted to reach out personally to discuss pricing for upcoming orders.

As you may be aware, we've experienced significant cost increases over the past year:
- Aluminum: +18%
- Tooling: +12%
- Utilities: +8%
- Insurance: +15%

We've absorbed these increases for the past 12 months, but we need to adjust our pricing to maintain the quality and service you expect.

Effective [date 90 days out], our pricing will increase by an average of 8-10% depending on material and complexity.

For our valued customers like you, we're offering:
- Current pricing honored on any PO received by [date 60 days out]
- Blanket order option to lock in pricing for the year
- Opportunity to discuss value engineering to offset cost increases

I'd like to schedule a call to discuss how we can continue to provide value and maintain our partnership.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

### Quality Standards and Specifications

**First Article Approval:**

For new parts or critical applications:
- Offer first article inspection (FAI)
- Get customer approval before proceeding
- Document what was approved
- Charge appropriately for FAI time

**Tolerance Interpretation:**

When drawings have unclear or contradictory tolerances:
- Never assume—always ask
- Document customer clarification
- Suggest drawing revision for future orders
- CYA (Cover Your Assets) with email confirmation

**Inspection Documentation:**

Set expectations about what's included:
- "Standard inspection includes dimensional verification to drawing requirements"
- "Certificate of Compliance included at no charge"
- "Full inspection report with measurements available for $X per part"
- "Material certification from mill available upon request"

### Managing Scope Creep

**Definition:** Scope creep is when customers gradually expand project requirements beyond original agreement without acknowledging cost or schedule impact.

**Common Examples:**
- "While you're at it, can you deburr the edges more?"
- "Can you package these individually instead of bulk?"
- "I know we said as-machined, but can you break the sharp edges?"
- "Can you add our label to each part?"

**Management Strategy:**

**Small, One-Time Requests:**
- Accommodate with grace: "Sure, happy to help"
- Builds goodwill
- But don't set expectation for future

**Recurring or Substantial Requests:**
- Acknowledge request professionally
- Explain impact: "I can certainly do that. It will add about 15 minutes per part and $X to the cost. Should I update the quote?"
- Get approval in writing
- Update pricing for future orders

**Preventing Scope Creep:**
- Detailed quote specifications
- Clear statements of what's included and not included
- Change order process
- Don't be afraid to ask for fair compensation

## 13.4 Handling Complaints and Issues

### Issue Response Framework

**Step 1: Acknowledge Immediately (within 1 hour)**

Don't wait until you have all the answers. Acknowledge that you received the complaint:

"Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I understand you received parts that don't meet the specified tolerance on the hole diameter. I'm investigating this right now and will get back to you within [timeframe] with an action plan."

**Step 2: Investigate (2-4 hours)**

Before responding with solutions:
- Verify the problem (are they correct?)
- Determine root cause
- Assess impact and urgency
- Consider solutions
- Determine responsibility (yours, theirs, supplier, etc.)

**Step 3: Respond with Action Plan (within 4 hours)**

```
Issue Summary:
- Part: ABC-12345
- Problem: Hole diameter measuring .255" vs. .250" +/-.002" specification
- Affected quantity: All 50 pieces

Investigation Results:
- Root cause: Reamer wear not caught during in-process inspection
- Our responsibility: Yes

Immediate Actions:
- Replacement parts already in production (completion Wed AM)
- Expedited shipping at our expense (delivery Thurs AM)
- Original parts: please hold for our pickup, or dispose per your preference

Long-Term Corrective Action:
- Implemented additional tool inspection checkpoint
- Updated first piece inspection protocol
- Review with machinist to prevent recurrence

Impact to You:
- Replacement parts: No charge
- Shipping: No charge
- Timeline: Delivery Thursday June 27 vs. original June 25 (+2 days)

We sincerely apologize for this issue and the impact to your schedule. Your business is important to us, and we're committed to earning back your confidence.

Please call me directly if you have any questions or concerns.
```

**Step 4: Execute Flawlessly**

- Do exactly what you promised
- Provide updates
- Follow through completely
- Check in after resolution

**Step 5: Follow-Up After Resolution**

A few days after resolving:

"I wanted to follow up on the replacement parts we delivered last week. Did they meet your requirements? Is there anything else we can do to make this right?"

### When the Customer is Wrong

Sometimes customers complain about issues that aren't actually problems or aren't your responsibility:

**Scenario 1: Customer Misread Drawing**

Customer: "These holes are in the wrong location!"
Reality: Holes are exactly per drawing; customer misread the dimensions.

**Poor Response:**
"No, you're wrong. Look at the drawing again."

**Better Response:**
"Let me verify against the drawing... I'm seeing the holes at 2.500" from edge, which matches dimension A on the drawing. Can you help me understand what you're seeing differently? I want to make sure I understand your concern."

If confirmed customer error:
"I can see how that dimension could be confusing. The parts are manufactured per the current drawing, but I understand they don't match your expectation. We have a few options:
1. Use parts as-is if they'll work
2. Rework parts to your preferred dimensions (cost: $X, timeline: +X days)
3. Update drawing for future orders

What would be most helpful?"

**Scenario 2: Customer Didn't Understand What They Ordered**

Customer: "Why aren't these deburred? They have sharp edges!"
Reality: Ordered "as-machined" finish, which doesn't include deburring.

**Poor Response:**
"You ordered as-machined. Deburring costs extra."

**Better Response:**
"I apologize for the confusion. The quote specified 'as-machined' finish, which is the raw state after machining. I should have clarified that this doesn't include deburring. I can deburr these parts for [cost] if needed, or I'll make sure we discuss finish requirements clearly on future orders. What would work best for you?"

**Scenario 3: Damage After Delivery**

Customer: "These parts arrived damaged!"
Reality: Parts shipped correctly but damaged in shipping.

**Response:**
"I'm sorry to hear the parts arrived damaged. Let me help resolve this. Can you send me photos of the damage and the packaging? This will help with the freight claim. I'll expedite replacement parts and handle the insurance claim paperwork. We'll have new parts to you by [date]."

Note: Even if not technically your fault, helping solve the problem builds loyalty.

### The Cost-Benefit of Making Things Right

**Scenario:**
- Job value: $500
- Your mistake: Parts don't meet specification
- Fix options:
  - Option A: Argue it's close enough, try to make customer accept ($0 cost)
  - Option B: Remake parts, expedite shipping ($600 cost)

**Short-term thinking:** Option A saves $600
**Long-term thinking:**
- This customer placed $12,000 in orders last year
- Referred two other customers worth $8,000/year
- Lost relationship cost: $20,000/year in revenue, $6,000/year in profit
- Choosing Option B: Best $600 you'll ever spend

**Rule of Thumb:**
When you make a mistake, fix it quickly and generously. The cost of making it right is almost always less than the cost of a damaged relationship.

## 13.5 Building Customer Loyalty

### Exceeding Expectations

**Small Gestures with Big Impact:**

**Delivery Surprises:**
- Deliver 2-3 days early when possible
- Include one or two extra parts in small orders (no charge)
- Better packaging than necessary
- Unexpected value-add (deburred edges even when not specified)

**Communication Excellence:**
- Proactive updates without being asked
- Remember details from previous conversations
- Acknowledge birthdays or company milestones
- Send holiday cards/gifts to key customers

**Technical Value-Add:**
- Point out potential design improvements
- Suggest cost-saving alternatives
- Offer engineering support
- Share relevant industry information

**Example:**
Customer orders 20 parts. You notice that changing hole diameter from 0.257" to 0.250" would allow use of standard drill and ream, reducing cost by $3/part.

You call customer: "I was programming your parts and noticed if we changed this hole to a standard .250" instead of .257", I could save you about $60 on this order and reduce lead time by a day. Would that dimension work for your application?"

Cost to you: 5-minute phone call
Value to customer: $60 savings + faster delivery
Loyalty impact: Priceless (they now see you as partner, not just vendor)

### Creating Loyalty Programs

**Volume Discounts:**

Structure pricing to encourage loyalty:
- Quantity breaks within single order
- Annual volume commitments
- Year-over-year growth incentives

**Example Tier Structure:**
- Standard: List pricing
- Bronze ($25K annual): 5% discount
- Silver ($50K annual): 8% discount + priority scheduling
- Gold ($100K annual): 12% discount + priority scheduling + dedicated support

**Blanket Orders:**

Offer annual contracts with benefits:
- Locked pricing for 12 months
- Guaranteed capacity allocation
- Streamlined ordering process
- Quarterly business reviews

**Preferred Customer Benefits:**
- Priority scheduling during busy periods
- First access to new capabilities
- Flexibility on payment terms
- Will-call pickup options
- Consignment arrangements

### Regular Check-Ins and Relationship Nurturing

**Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs):**

For A-level customers, schedule regular business reviews:

**Agenda:**
1. Review past quarter metrics:
   - Orders placed, total spend
   - On-time delivery %
   - Quality issues (if any)
   - Areas of success

2. Discuss upcoming needs:
   - Upcoming projects
   - Capacity planning
   - New requirements

3. Continuous improvement:
   - Feedback on your performance
   - Ideas for cost reduction
   - Process improvements

4. Relationship development:
   - Get to know their business
   - Understand challenges
   - Identify ways to add value

**Periodic "Just Checking In" Contacts:**

For B-level customers:
- Quarterly email or call
- "Just wanted to check in. How is everything going? Do you have any upcoming projects where we could help?"
- No sales pitch, just relationship maintenance

**Industry Events:**

- Attend trade shows where your customers exhibit
- Invite customers to lunch/dinner at events
- Host customer appreciation events
- Facility open houses

### Building Personal Relationships

**Remember:** People buy from people they like and trust.

**Getting Personal (Appropriately):**
- Remember names of team members
- Ask about family, hobbies, interests (if they share)
- Find common ground
- Be genuine, not salesy

**Example:**
If customer mentions their kid's soccer team, follow up on next call: "Hey, how did your daughter's soccer tournament go last weekend?"

Small detail, big impact on relationship.

**Facility Visits:**
- Invite customers to visit your shop
- Show them how parts are made
- Introduce them to your team
- Builds trust and understanding

**Be Reliable and Consistent:**
- Return calls promptly
- Do what you say you'll do
- Be honest even when it's uncomfortable
- Admit mistakes quickly
- Consistent quality and delivery

**Loyalty is Built on:**
1. Technical competence (you can make the part)
2. Reliability (you do what you promise)
3. Communication (you keep them informed)
4. Value (fair pricing, added value)
5. Relationship (they like working with you)

All five must be present. Missing any one weakens the relationship.

## 13.6 When to Fire a Customer

Not all customer relationships are worth maintaining. Sometimes the best business decision is to end a customer relationship.

### Warning Signs of Problem Customers

**Payment Issues:**
- Consistently late payments despite agreements
- Disputes invoices repeatedly
- Asks for extended terms they don't honor
- NSF checks or declined credit cards
- Demands discounts after work is complete

**Operational Issues:**
- Unreasonable demands and expectations
- Excessive hand-holding and support required
- Constant scope creep without compensation
- Last-minute rush orders without premium pay
- Rejects parts that meet specification
- Demands free rework for buyer's remorse

**Relationship Issues:**
- Abusive or disrespectful communication
- Talks negatively about you to others
- Unreasonable and inflexible
- Unwilling to pay fair prices
- Creates conflict with your team

**Strategic Misalignment:**
- Work that loses money consistently
- Ties up capacity you could sell to better customers
- High liability risk
- Outside your core competencies
- Reputation risk

### Calculating Customer Profitability

**Not all revenue is good revenue.** Some customers cost more to serve than they're worth.

**Customer Profitability Analysis:**

```
Customer: XYZ Corporation
Annual Revenue: $15,000

Direct Costs:
- Material: $5,000
- Labor (machine time): $4,000
- Tooling: $500
- Subtotal Direct: $9,500

Indirect Costs:
- Quoting time (20 quotes @ $30 avg): $600
- Communication overhead (5 hrs @ $50): $250
- Rework/warranty: $800
- Late payment cost (avg 75 days vs 30): $200
- Admin/collection time: $300
- Subtotal Indirect: $2,150

Total Costs: $11,650
Revenue: $15,000
Gross Profit: $3,350
Gross Margin: 22%

vs. average customer: 38% gross margin

Conclusion: Below average profitability, but not necessarily unprofitable. Consider:
- Can we improve efficiency?
- Can we raise prices?
- Is relationship improving or deteriorating?
- Could we use this capacity for better customers?
```

**When Customer is Actually Unprofitable:**

```
Customer: ABC Industries
Annual Revenue: $8,000

Direct Costs: $6,500
Indirect Costs: $3,200 (excessive support, rework, collection efforts)
Total Costs: $9,700

Net Loss: -$1,700

Conclusion: You're paying $1,700/year for the privilege of serving this customer. This must change or end.
```

### How to Fire a Customer

**Option 1: Price Them Out**

Raise prices to level where relationship becomes profitable or they leave:

"Thank you for your quote request. Our pricing for this work has been updated as follows: [+30-50% increase]. Please let me know if you'd like to proceed at this pricing."

Many problem customers will self-select out. If they accept, at least you're profitable.

**Option 2: Reduce Service Level**

Make relationship transactional instead of partnership:
- No more rush orders
- No more special accommodations
- Strict payment terms (credit card up front, for example)
- Minimum order quantities

**Option 3: Direct Conversation (for salvageable relationships)**

If customer is valuable but relationship has issues:

"I wanted to have a frank conversation about our business relationship. We value your business, but we've been experiencing challenges with [specific issue]. For us to continue working together profitably, we need to address this. Here's what we need going forward: [specific requirements]. Can we make this work?"

Possible outcomes:
- Customer acknowledges and improves (relationship saved)
- Customer defends behavior (relationship ending, no loss)
- Customer negotiates solution (possible improvement)

**Option 4: Professional Termination (for clearly unprofitable/problematic customers)**

```
Dear [Customer],

Thank you for your business over the past [time period]. After careful review of our operations and strategic direction, we've determined that we're not the best fit for your manufacturing needs going forward.

We will complete any current orders in our queue, but we won't be able to accept new orders after [date 30-60 days out].

We can recommend the following shops that may be better suited to your requirements:

**Important Principles:**
- Be professional and courteous
- Don't burn bridges (industry is small)
- Complete committed work
- Don't badmouth them (even if tempted)
- Document reasons (in case of dispute)

### When NOT to Fire a Customer

**Temporary Issues:**
- New customer learning your processes (give time)
- One-time payment issue with valid explanation
- Isolated incident, otherwise good relationship
- Economic hardship affecting payment (work out plan)

**Growing Pains:**
- Your expanding business creating relationship strain
- Issues caused by your mistakes or growing capacity
- Communication breakdowns you can fix

**Strategic Value:**
- Low margin but introduces you to new industry
- Low margin but provides consistent base load
- Difficult work that builds capabilities
- Prestigious name that enhances credibility

**Bottom Line:**
Fire customers that are:
- Consistently unprofitable after good-faith improvement attempts
- Abusive to you or your team

- Taking capacity you could fill with better customers

Keep customers that:
- Are profitable or could be with reasonable changes

## 13.7 Diversification vs. Key Account Dependency

### The Concentration Risk Problem

**Scenario: The 80/20 Trap**

Your shop does $500K in annual revenue:
- Customer A: $400K (80%)
- Customers B-M: $100K (20%)

**Question:** Is this good or bad?

**Optimistic View:**
- Customer A is wonderful: great relationship, consistent orders, profitable
- Focus allows optimization and efficiency
- Simpler operations (fewer customers to manage)

**Pessimistic View (Reality):**
- Customer A loses a contract: your revenue drops 80% overnight
- Customer A demands 15% price reduction: you have no leverage
- Customer A's buyer retires: new buyer changes suppliers
- Customer A's industry declines: you decline with it
- Customer A finds cheaper option: you're finished

**Truth:** This is high-risk business structure, no matter how good the current relationship.

### Recommended Customer Concentration Limits

**Healthy Diversification Guidelines:**

**By Customer:**
- No single customer: >30% of revenue
- Top 3 customers: <50% of revenue
- Top 5 customers: <70% of revenue

**By Industry:**
- No single industry: >40% of revenue
- Diversification across 3+ industries ideal

**By Part/Product:**
- No single part number: >15% of revenue
- No single product family: >30% of revenue

**By Geography:**
- Consider recession risk by region
- National customer base more stable than local

### Building Diversification

**When You're Over-Concentrated:**

**Phase 1: Acknowledge Reality (Month 1)**
- Calculate actual concentration risk
- Assess vulnerability
- Communicate with team about need to diversify

**Phase 2: Protect Current Revenue (Ongoing)**
- Strengthen relationship with major customer(s)
- Deliver exceptional value
- Long-term contracts if possible
- But don't become complacent

**Phase 3: Grow Other Customers (Months 2-12)**
- Dedicate time to new customer acquisition
- Sales goal: Add 2-3 new customers per quarter
- Focus on different industries than major customer
- Accept smaller orders to build relationships

**Phase 4: Manage Growth Mix (Year 2+)**
- As total revenue grows, maintain or reduce major customer absolute dollars
- Grow percentage from other customers
- Target: Major customer becomes <30% over 2-3 years

**Example Timeline:**

**Year 1:**
- Customer A: $400K (80%)
- Others: $100K (20%)
- Total: $500K

**Year 2:** (add $150K from new customers, maintain Customer A)
- Customer A: $400K (62%)
- Others: $250K (38%)
- Total: $650K

**Year 3:** (add another $150K, grow Customer A 10%)
- Customer A: $440K (55%)
- Others: $360K (45%)
- Total: $800K

**Year 4:** (add $100K, grow Customer A 5%)
- Customer A: $462K (47%)
- Others: $520K (53%)
- Total: $982K

**Year 5:**
- Customer A: $485K (42%)
- Others: $675K (58%)
- Total: $1.16M

Now if you lose Customer A, you lose 42% of revenue instead of 80%—still painful but survivable.

### The Key Account Balance

**Key Accounts are Valuable:**

Don't over-correct and treat major customers poorly in pursuit of diversification. Key accounts are valuable:

**Benefits of Key Accounts:**
- Predictable revenue
- Lower quoting/acquisition costs
- Better pricing possible with volume
- Opportunity for process optimization
- Deeper relationships
- Collaborative improvement
- Partnership opportunities

**Managing Key Accounts While Diversifying:**

**For the Customer:**
- Continue exceptional service
- Transparent communication
- Partnership approach
- Competitive pricing (but not below profitability)
- Innovation and continuous improvement

**For Your Business:**
- Honest assessment of concentration risk
- Proactive diversification (not reactive after loss)
- Strategic growth planning
- Relationship depth (multiple contacts, long-term contracts)
- Monitoring of customer's business health

**Communication with Key Customer:**

If customer asks: "I noticed you're adding new customers. Are we still a priority?"

**Good Response:**
"Absolutely. You're a valued partner and that hasn't changed. We're growing our overall capacity and capabilities, which actually helps us serve you better with backup capacity and improved efficiency. Your orders remain a priority, and we're committed to the partnership."

**Never Say:**
"We can't be dependent on just you" (even if true)

### Portfolio Management Strategy

**Think Like an Investment Portfolio:**

Just as financial advisors recommend diversified investments, your customer portfolio should be balanced:

**"Blue Chip" Customers (30-40% of revenue):**
- Characteristics: Large, stable, long-term, lower margin
- Purpose: Revenue stability, capacity utilization
- Management: Partnership approach, continuous improvement

**"Growth Stock" Customers (30-40% of revenue):**
- Characteristics: Medium size, growing, higher margin potential
- Purpose: Future key accounts, profit growth
- Management: Invest in relationship, grow account

**"High-Yield" Customers (20-30% of revenue):**
- Characteristics: Smaller orders, premium pricing, niche work
- Purpose: Profitability, capability development
- Management: Efficient service, maintain pricing

**"Speculative" Customers (10% of revenue):**
- Characteristics: New relationships, new industries, test orders
- Purpose: Diversification, market learning, future growth
- Management: Evaluate fit, grow promising relationships

### Warning Signs of Dangerous Dependency

**Single Customer Red Flags:**
- You added equipment specifically for them
- You hired employees specifically for them
- You lease space sized to their volume
- Your team knows you "can't afford to lose them"
- You accept unprofitable pricing "to keep the relationship"
- You don't prospect for new business because you're "too busy"
- You've turned down other work to accommodate them

**If Any of These are True:** You're extremely vulnerable. Start diversifying immediately.

### Recovery From Customer Loss

**If You Do Lose a Major Customer:**

**Immediate (Week 1):**
- Assess financial impact
- Calculate runway (how long can you survive?)
- Communicate with team honestly
- Activate cash preservation mode

**Short-term (Months 1-3):**
- Aggressive sales and marketing
- Contact every warm lead
- Reduce pricing if necessary to fill capacity
- Consider temporary layoffs if needed
- Cut non-essential expenses
- Explore financing if needed

**Medium-term (Months 3-12):**
- Rebuild customer base with diversification
- Evaluate what went wrong
- Adjust business model
- Right-size operation if necessary

**Many shops have survived major customer loss through aggressive action and resilience. But it's far better to build diversification before you need it.**

## Conclusion

Customer Relationship Management is perhaps the single most important determinant of long-term business success. Technical excellence gets you in the door, but relationship excellence keeps you there and helps you grow.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Understand True Needs:** Go beyond the drawing to understand customer needs, context, and priorities.

2. **Communicate Professionally:** Fast, clear, professional communication builds trust and prevents problems.

3. **Manage Expectations:** Under-promise and over-deliver on timelines, pricing, and quality. Set clear expectations upfront.

4. **Handle Problems Gracefully:** Mistakes happen. How you respond to problems defines your reputation more than the problems themselves.

5. **Build Loyalty:** Small gestures, consistent excellence, and genuine relationships create customer loyalty that survives price competition.

6. **Know When to Walk Away:** Not all customers are worth keeping. Fire unprofitable or problematic customers to protect your business and team.

7. **Diversify Strategically:** Customer concentration creates catastrophic risk. Build a diversified customer base while maintaining key account relationships.

8. **Balance Portfolio:** Think of customers as investment portfolio—balance between stability, growth, and profitability.

**Action Items:**

1. **Segment Your Customers:**
   - Categorize as A, B, C, or Problem
   - Calculate profitability by customer
   - Determine concentration risk

2. **Establish Communication Standards:**
   - Define response time expectations
   - Create quote and update templates
   - Implement CRM or customer tracking system

3. **Create Loyalty Programs:**
   - Define volume tiers and benefits
   - Develop QBR process for key accounts
   - Plan customer appreciation initiatives

4. **Assess and Address Risk:**
   - Calculate customer concentration percentages
   - If over-concentrated, create diversification plan
   - Set targets for balanced portfolio

5. **Audit Existing Relationships:**
   - Identify problem customers
   - Make plan to improve or exit unprofitable relationships
   - Invest in developing growth customers

**Remember:**

Your customers are your business. Without them, your technical skills, equipment, and facility are worthless. Invest in customer relationships with the same care and attention you invest in your equipment and technical capabilities.

Build a reputation for:
- Technical excellence
- Reliability and honesty
- Clear communication
- Fair pricing
- Exceptional service
- Genuine partnership

Do these consistently, and you'll build a sustainable, profitable business with loyal customers who send you referrals, stick with you through challenges, and help you grow.

*"People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel."* – Maya Angelou

This applies to customer relationships as much as personal ones. Make your customers feel valued, respected, and well-served, and they'll remain loyal even when competitors offer lower prices.
