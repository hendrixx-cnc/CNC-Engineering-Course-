# Module 10 – Robotic Arm


## Overview

Robotic arms represent the most versatile form of industrial automation, capable of complex manipulation tasks requiring multiple degrees of freedom and full spatial orientation control. Unlike the pick-and-place systems covered in Module 9, multi-axis robotic arms can perform welding, assembly, material removal, painting, inspection, and other tasks requiring dexterity and programmable tool paths in three-dimensional space.

Integration of robotic arms with CNC machining centers creates flexible manufacturing cells that combine subtractive manufacturing with automated handling, assembly, and finishing operations. This module explores articulated robot design, kinematics, control systems, and practical integration with CNC equipment.

## Safety Warning

Industrial robots can cause serious injury or death through crushing, impact, entanglement, or other hazards. All robotic systems must comply with ISO 10218 (industrial robots), ISO/TS 15066 (collaborative robots), ANSI/RIA R15.06, and applicable local regulations.
