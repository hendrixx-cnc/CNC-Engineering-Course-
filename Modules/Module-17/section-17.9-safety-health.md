# 17.9 Safety and Health Hazards in Advanced Materials Machining

## Respiratory Hazards

### Carbon Fiber Dust

**Particle Characteristics**:
- Size: 5-10 μm diameter, length >>diameter (fiber-like)
- **Respirable**: Particles <10 μm reach deep lung (alveoli)
- Geometry: Similar to asbestos (length:diameter ratio >3:1)
- Biopersistent: Body cannot break down or clear effectively

**Health Effects**:

**Acute** (short-term):
- Cough, throat irritation
- Difficulty breathing (if heavy exposure)
- Eye irritation (fibers scratch cornea)

**Chronic** (long-term):
- **Possible carcinogen**: IARC Group 2B (possibly carcinogenic to humans)
- Lung fibrosis (scarring): Similar mechanism to asbestos
- No definitive epidemiological studies (material relatively new)
- Precautionary principle: Treat as serious hazard

**Occupational Exposure Limit**:
- **No OSHA PEL** (not yet regulated)
- NIOSH recommends: **5 mg/m³** (8-hour TWA) for respirable particles
- UK HSE: **2 fibers/cm³** (for fibers >5 μm long)
- Some companies: Self-impose 1-2 mg/m³ (more conservative)

**Exposure Scenarios**:
- Routing carbon fiber: Dust clouds visible → very high exposure
- Grinding: Fine dust generation (worst case)
- Hand sanding: Localized dust (still hazardous)

**Example Measurement**:
- Routing CFRP without dust collection
- Breathing zone sample: 15 mg/m³
- **3× over NIOSH recommendation** → unacceptable

### Glass Fiber Dust

**Particle Characteristics**:
- Diameter: 5-15 μm (respirable)
- Length: Broken fibers during cutting
- Less biopersistent than carbon fiber (body can dissolve slowly)

**Health Effects**:

**Acute**:
- Skin irritation ("itching"): Fibers embed in skin
- Eye irritation: Mechanical scratch
- Respiratory irritation: Cough, sore throat

**Chronic**:
- Lung fibrosis (possible): Less evidence than asbestos
- IARC Group 3: Not classifiable as carcinogenic (insufficient evidence)
- Still hazardous (respiratory irritant)

**Occupational Exposure Limit**:
- OSHA PEL: **15 mg/m³** (total dust), **5 mg/m³** (respirable)
- ACGIH TLV: **5 mg/m³** (respirable), **1 fiber/cm³** (fibers >5 μm)

**Less Hazardous than Carbon Fiber**: But still requires dust control

### Ceramic Dust

**Crystalline Silica** (quartz):

Many ceramics contain silica:
- Porcelain: 20-40% silica
- Alumina (lower grades): 1-10% silica impurity
- Silicon carbide, silicon nitride: Oxidize to silica at high temp

**Health Effects**:
- **Silicosis**: Progressive, irreversible lung disease
  - Inhaled silica particles engulfed by macrophages
  - Macrophages die, release fibrotic agents
  - Lung tissue scars (fibrosis)
  - Breathing capacity declines
  - Can progress even after exposure stops
  - **No cure**
- Latency: 10-30 years from exposure to symptoms
- Increased risk: Lung cancer, tuberculosis, autoimmune diseases

**Occupational Exposure Limit**:
- OSHA PEL: **0.05 mg/m³** (respirable crystalline silica, 8-hour TWA)
- **Extremely low** (one of the strictest limits)
- Difficult to achieve without engineering controls

**Silica Rule** (29 CFR 1910.1053):
- Requires: Exposure assessment, engineering controls, medical surveillance
- Recordkeeping: 30 years
- Applies to: Any operation generating silica dust (grinding, sawing)

**Other Ceramic Dusts**:

**Aluminum oxide** (alumina):
- OSHA PEL: **15 mg/m³** (total dust), **5 mg/m³** (respirable)
- Respiratory irritant (less hazardous than silica)
- Chronic exposure: Possible lung disease (aluminosis, rare)

**Zirconia** (zirconium oxide):
- OSHA PEL: **5 mg/m³** (respirable)
- Generally low toxicity
- Thermal processes (laser cutting): Releases zirconium fumes (more hazardous)

**Beryllium oxide** (BeO):
- **Extremely toxic**: Beryllium disease (chronic berylliosis)
- OSHA PEL: **0.2 μg/m³** (0.0002 mg/m³!)
- Specialized handling, rarely used in general machining

### Resin Dust and Fumes

**Epoxy Dust** (cured):
- Respiratory irritant
- **Sensitizer**: Repeated exposure → allergic reactions develop
  - Initial: No reaction
  - After weeks/months: Sudden allergic response (rash, asthma)
  - Once sensitized: Permanent (even tiny exposure causes reaction)
- OSHA PEL: Variable by specific epoxy (0.1-5 mg/m³ typical)

**Phenolic Resin** (grinding/cutting):
- Releases formaldehyde (VOC)
- OSHA PEL (formaldehyde): **0.75 ppm** (8-hour TWA)
- Carcinogen (IARC Group 1)
- Requires ventilation

**Polyester Resin**:
- Releases styrene (VOC) during cure and thermal decomposition
- OSHA PEL (styrene): **100 ppm** (8-hour TWA)
- Short-term: Dizziness, headache
- Long-term: Neurological effects

## Skin Hazards

### Fiber Irritation

**Carbon Fiber**:
- Stiff, sharp fibers (7 μm diameter)
- Embed in skin → itching, rash
- Difficult to remove (too small to see/grasp)
- Splinters work deeper over time

**Glass Fiber**:
- Similar to carbon fiber (worse due to larger diameter)
- "Fiberglass itch" well-known

**Prevention**:
- Long sleeves (tightly woven fabric)
- Gloves (nitrile, leather)
- Wash exposed skin (cold water, don't rub → drives fibers deeper)
- Adhesive tape: Dab on skin, lift fibers

### Chemical Exposure

**Uncured Resins**:
- Epoxy: Sensitizer (skin contact → allergic dermatitis)
- Once sensitized: Blistering rash from minimal exposure
- Prevention: Gloves (nitrile), avoid skin contact

**Solvents** (cleaning, laminating):
- Acetone: Dries skin (dermatitis)
- Methyl ethyl ketone (MEK): Skin irritant, absorbed through skin
- Prevention: Gloves, minimize contact

**Coolants** (machining):
- Water-based coolants: Can harbor bacteria (dermatitis)
- Oil-based: Clog pores (acne-like rash)
- Prevention: Barrier cream, wash after exposure

## Eye Hazards

**Particulate Hazards**:
- Carbon fiber: Scratches cornea (painful, slow healing)
- Ceramic dust: Abrasive (grinding particles)
- Flying chips (rare with composites, common with ceramics)

**Chemical Splash**:
- Resins (epoxy, polyester): Irritant, can cause damage
- Coolants: Bacterial contamination (infection risk)

**Prevention**:
- Safety glasses with side shields (minimum)
- Face shield (when dust clouds visible)
- Goggles (chemical splash protection)

**First Aid**:
- Eye flush station (15 minutes continuous rinse)
- Seek medical attention (foreign body, chemical exposure)

## Fire and Explosion Hazards

### Carbon Fiber Conductivity

**Electrical Hazard**:
- Carbon fiber is electrically conductive (similar to graphite)
- Fine dust settles on electronics
- Can cause short circuits:
  - CNC controller failure
  - Motor drive damage
  - Instrumentation malfunction

**Static Electricity**:
- Carbon fiber dust generates static during handling
- Accumulation → spark discharge
- Dust cloud ignition possible

**Prevention**:
- Grounded equipment (dissipate static)
- Sealed control cabinets (positive pressure)
- Dust collection (prevent accumulation)
- No open flames in machining area

### Dust Explosions

**Combustible Dust**:
- Organic materials (resin dust, wood) form explosive mixtures
- Carbon fiber dust: Combustible
- Fine particles + oxygen + ignition source = explosion

**Explosion Pentagon**:
1. Combustible dust
2. Oxygen (air)
3. Ignition source (spark, hot surface)
4. Confinement (dust cloud in enclosed space)
5. Dispersion (dust suspended, not settled)

**Remove any one factor** → no explosion

**Historical Incidents**:
- Dust explosions in woodworking, grain handling (devastating)
- Composites: Lower risk (less fuel) but still possible

**Prevention**:
- Dust collection (remove fuel)
- Eliminate ignition sources (no sparking tools, hot work permits)
- Vent enclosures (prevent confinement)
- Housekeeping (prevent dust accumulation on surfaces)

**OSHA Combustible Dust NEP** (National Emphasis Program):
- Inspections targeting dust hazards
- Fines for non-compliance ($15,000-150,000 per violation)

### Resin Fires

**Uncured Resins**:
- Flammable liquids (epoxy, polyester)
- Flash point: 200-400°F (moderate)
- Storage: Flammable cabinet

**Cured Resin Dust**:
- Combustible (burns if ignited)
- Lower risk than uncured (not liquid)

**Prevention**:
- No smoking, no open flames
- Grounded containers (static dissipation)
- Minimize inventory (less fuel)

## Chemical Hazards

### Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)

**Sources**:
- Resin systems during cure (styrene, formaldehyde)
- Solvents (acetone, MEK) for cleaning
- Thermal decomposition during machining (burnt resin)

**Health Effects**:

- Change coolant regularly (don't just top off)
- Clean sump (remove residue, biofilm)
- Monitor pH, concentration

**Alternative**: Dry machining or mist systems (less bacteria risk)

## Noise Hazards

**High-Speed Machining**:
- Composites: 85-95 dBA typical (routing, sawing)
- Ceramics: 90-100 dBA (grinding)
- OSHA PEL: **90 dBA** (8-hour TWA)
- Exceeding PEL → hearing protection required

**Hearing Protection**:
- Earplugs: 15-30 dB reduction (NRR rating)
- Earmuffs: 20-35 dB reduction
- Combination (plugs + muffs): 30-40 dB reduction

**Engineering Controls**:
- Enclosures (reduce noise at source)
- Vibration damping (machine mounts)

**Hearing Conservation Program** (if >85 dBA):
- Audiometric testing (annual)
- Training (noise hazards)
- Hearing protection provided

## Ergonomic Hazards

**Repetitive Motion**:

- Carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis

**Awkward Postures**:
- Reaching into enclosures
- Working on large panels (overhead, bent)

**Vibration** (hand tools):
- Grinders, sanders
- Hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS): Numbness, loss of dexterity

**Prevention**:
- Rotate tasks (vary motions)
- Ergonomic tools (padded handles, low vibration)
- Mechanical assists (lifts for heavy parts)

## Machine Hazards

**Rotating Tooling**:
- Spindle speeds: 10,000-60,000 RPM typical
