# Module 9 – Pick & Place Robot


## 9.1.1 Role in Modern Manufacturing Automation

Pick and place robots represent the convergence of precision motion control, machine vision, and process integration—automating material handling tasks that constitute 30-50% of manufacturing cycle time across industries from electronics assembly (0.1-10g components at 200+ picks/minute) to automotive parts handling (5-100 kg castings at 5-15 cycles/minute). These systems eliminate repetitive manual labor while achieving positioning repeatability (±0.01-0.05 mm typical) impossible for human operators, enabling lights-out manufacturing and just-in-time production strategies that reduce inventory costs 40-60% compared to batch processing.

**Economic Drivers:**

1. **Labor cost reduction:** Single robot replaces 1.5-3 FTE operators ($45k-65k/year each), achieving ROI in 1.5-3 years for 2-shift operation
2. **Cycle time reduction:** Automated part transfer typically 2-4× faster than manual handling (3-5 seconds robot vs. 8-15 seconds operator)
3. **Quality improvement:** Consistent placement eliminates human error (drop rates <0.01% vs. 0.1-0.5% manual), reducing scrap and rework costs
4. **Flexibility:** Programmable systems adapt to product changes within minutes (vs. hours/days for dedicated automation), supporting high-mix manufacturing

**Market Context (2024):**

- Global industrial robot installations: 3.1 million units (IFR data)
- Pick and place robots: 35-40% of industrial robot market share
- Annual growth rate: 12-15% (driven by e-commerce warehousing, electronics miniaturization)
- Average system cost: $25k-150k (Cartesian) to $180k-500k (SCARA/Delta with vision)

## 9.1.2 Robot Architecture Comparison and Selection Criteria

### Cartesian (Gantry) Robots

**Kinematic Structure:**

Three orthogonal linear axes (X, Y, Z) define rectangular workspace with simple forward kinematics:

$$\mathbf{P}_{end-effector} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} d_X \\ d_Y \\ d_Z \end{bmatrix}$$

where $d_X$, $d_Y$, $d_Z$ are commanded axis displacements (no coordinate transformation required).

**Performance Characteristics:**

| Parameter | Typical Range | Design Driver |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Workspace** | 500×500×300 mm to 6,000×3,000×1,500 mm | Application footprint |
| **Repeatability** | ±0.02-0.05 mm | Mechanical stiffness, encoder resolution |
| **Payload** | 1-100+ kg | Beam deflection, motor sizing |
| **Speed** | 3-10 m/s linear, 2-5 m/s² acceleration | Belt/screw drive limits, vibration control |
| **Cycle time** | 2-5 seconds typical | Path length + acceleration profile |

**Advantages:**
- **Rigid structure:** Moment arm constant across workspace (vs. SCARA cantilever), enabling heavy payloads
- **Scalable workspace:** Add length to axes independently without kinematic complexity
- **Simple programming:** Cartesian coordinates match CAD/CAM models directly
- **High precision:** Ball screw drives achieve ±0.01 mm repeatability over 2-4 m travel

**Limitations:**
- **Large footprint:** Gantry frame requires 1.5-2× workspace area for structural supports
- **Lower speed:** Linear drives limited to ~10 m/s vs. 15-20 m/s for rotational joints (SCARA)
- **Higher cost:** Three independent drive systems vs. shared drive components (Delta)

**Typical Applications:** CNC machine loading (lathes, mills), palletizing, large part handling (automotive castings 20-80 kg), bin picking with extended reach

### SCARA (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm)

**Kinematic Structure:**

Two rotational joints ($\theta_1$, $\theta_2$) plus vertical linear axis ($d_Z$) create cylindrical workspace. Forward kinematics:

$$\begin{align}
x &= L_1 \cos\theta_1 + L_2 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2) \\
y &= L_1 \sin\theta_1 + L_2 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2) \\
z &= d_Z
\end{align}$$

where $L_1$, $L_2$ are link lengths (typically 300-600 mm each).

**Inverse Kinematics:**

Given target position $(x, y)$, solve for joint angles:

$$\theta_2 = \pm \arccos\left(\frac{x^2 + y^2 - L_1^2 - L_2^2}{2 L_1 L_2}\right)$$

$$\theta_1 = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) - \arctan\left(\frac{L_2 \sin\theta_2}{L_1 + L_2 \cos\theta_2}\right)$$

Two solutions exist (elbow-up/elbow-down configurations), requiring singularity avoidance algorithms.

**Performance Characteristics:**

- **Workspace:** Annular cylinder (R_outer = L₁+L₂ = 600-1,200 mm, R_inner = |L₁-L₂| = 50-200 mm)
- **Repeatability:** ±0.01-0.02 mm (better than Cartesian due to rotary encoders on short moment arms)
- **Speed:** 150-300+ picks/minute (rotational acceleration 5-10 rad/s² enables fast horizontal motion)
- **Payload:** 1-20 kg typical (limited by cantilever loading at full extension)

**Advantages:**
- **Compact footprint:** Overhead mounting frees floor space beneath workspace
- **High speed:** Rotational dynamics achieve 0.5-1 second cycle times for short moves
- **Cost-effective:** Two motors + vertical actuator simpler than three Cartesian axes

**Limitations:**
- **Workspace shape:** Annular ring with unusable center region and dead zones at singularities
- **Payload variation:** Cantilever moment varies with radius (max torque at full extension = payload × (L₁+L₂))
- **Complex kinematics:** Inverse solution requires trigonometry, potential singularities at $\theta_2 = 0°$ or $\pm180°$

**Typical Applications:** Electronics assembly (PCB component placement), small parts handling (<5 kg), high-speed sorting, clean room operations (pharmaceutical, semiconductor)

### Delta (Parallel Linkage) Robots

**Kinematic Structure:**

Three actuated arms connect to end-effector via parallelogram linkages, maintaining constant orientation. Inverse kinematics solved via constraint equations:

$$f_i(\theta_i, x, y, z) = 0, \quad i = 1, 2, 3$$

where each constraint represents circle intersection (arm length constraint).

**Performance Characteristics:**

- **Workspace:** Inverted cone (Ø400-800 mm × 200-400 mm height)
- **Repeatability:** ±0.1-0.5 mm (lower than serial robots due to accumulated linkage tolerances)
- **Speed:** 200-300+ picks/minute (parallel structure distributes inertia across three motors)
- **Payload:** 0.5-10 kg (lightweight linkages optimize acceleration over load capacity)

**Advantages:**
- **Extreme speed:** Parallel actuation achieves 10-15 g acceleration (vs. 1-3 g for serial robots)
- **Low moving mass:** End-effector carries only linkages, motors remain stationary
- **Compact footprint:** Overhead mounting with minimal floor space requirement

**Limitations:**
- **Limited workspace:** Small volume relative to robot size (workspace ≈ 10-15% of installation envelope)
- **Orientation constraint:** End-effector remains parallel to base (no wrist articulation in basic designs)
- **Complex calibration:** Parallel kinematics sensitive to link length errors (±0.1 mm linkage tolerance → ±0.5 mm positioning error)

**Typical Applications:** High-speed packaging (food, pharmaceuticals at 200-300 picks/minute), light parts sorting (<2 kg), vision-guided pick from conveyor, rapid assembly operations

## 9.1.3 Performance Specifications and Selection Framework

### Critical Performance Metrics

**1. Repeatability vs. Accuracy**

- **Repeatability:** Standard deviation of position when returning to same commanded point (σ = ±0.01-0.05 mm typical)
- **Accuracy:** Deviation from true Cartesian position across workspace (systematic error 0.1-1.0 mm, correctable via calibration)

Most applications specify repeatability (consistent placement matters more than absolute position accuracy, which can be calibrated).

**2. Cycle Time Breakdown**

Total cycle time comprises:

$$t_{cycle} = t_{approach} + t_{grip/vacuum} + t_{transfer} + t_{release} + t_{return}$$

**Example calculation** (SCARA picking 50 mm × 50 mm part, 300 mm transfer distance):

- Approach move: $t = \sqrt{\frac{4d}{a}}$ where $d = 100$ mm (Z-axis descent), $a = 5$ m/s² → $t = 0.28$ s
- Vacuum stabilization: 0.15 s (pressure ramp to -60 kPa)
- Transfer move: Trapezoidal profile at $v_{max} = 3$ m/s, $a = 8$ m/s² → $t = 0.45$ s
- Release: 0.05 s (valve venting)
- Return: 0.35 s (optimized path)

**Total: 1.28 seconds = 47 picks/minute**

Optimization targets approach and transfer times (60-70% of cycle), requiring path planning and acceleration profiling (Section 9.5).

**3. Payload Capacity and Duty Cycle**

Rated payload assumes 100% duty cycle (continuous operation). Intermittent operation allows 120-150% overload:

$$\text{Intermittent payload} = \text{Rated payload} \times \sqrt{\frac{100\%}{\text{Duty cycle}\%}}$$

For 10 kg rated robot at 40% duty cycle:

$$\text{Peak payload} = 10 \times \sqrt{\frac{100}{40}} = 15.8 \text{ kg}$$

### Selection Decision Matrix

| Factor | Choose Cartesian When: | Choose SCARA When: | Choose Delta When: |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Workspace** | Large volume (>2 m³), irregular shape | Compact area (<1 m²), overhead clearance | Small area (<0.5 m³), overhead mounting |
| **Payload** | >20 kg, moment loading | 1-20 kg, point loads | <5 kg, lightweight components |
| **Speed** | <30 picks/min acceptable | 50-150 picks/min required | >150 picks/min critical |
| **Precision** | ±0.01-0.02 mm repeatability | ±0.01-0.02 mm repeatability | ±0.1-0.5 mm acceptable |
| **Footprint** | Floor space available (gantry frame) | Minimal floor space (overhead mount) | Minimal floor space (overhead mount) |
| **Cost budget** | $35k-80k entry-level | $50k-120k mid-range | $80k-200k high-speed |
| **Programming** | Simple Cartesian coordinates | Moderate kinematic complexity | Complex calibration required |

## 9.1.4 Integration with CNC Manufacturing Systems

Pick and place robots extend CNC machine utilization from 60-70% (operator-loaded) to 85-95% (automated loading), enabling:

**1. Machine Tending**

- **Lathe loading:** Robot presents bar stock or castings to chuck, removes finished parts, places in inspection station
- **Mill loading:** Palletized workpieces transferred from fixture queue to machine table, coordinated with tool changes
- **Multi-machine cells:** Single robot services 2-4 CNC machines during cutting operations (overlapped cycle)

**Typical Sequence:**

```
1. Robot checks machine status (M-code signal: "Ready for load")
2. Open machine door (servo-actuated or pneumatic interlock)
3. Remove finished part (wait for spindle stop + coolant flush)
4. Transfer to unload station (vision inspection optional)
5. Pick new workpiece from fixture queue
6. Place in machine work envelope (precision locating pins ±0.02 mm)
7. Close door + send ready signal to CNC controller
8. CNC begins machining cycle while robot services next machine
```

**2. Part Inspection and Sorting**

Vision-guided robots measure critical dimensions (±0.01 mm optical CMM), sort by tolerance class:

- **Pass:** Route to shipping container
- **Rework:** Stack for secondary operations
- **Scrap:** Reject bin with defect logging

Integration with SPC (Statistical Process Control) provides real-time feedback to CNC controller, adjusting tool offsets to maintain tolerances.

**3. Assembly Operations**

Sequential pick and place builds subassemblies:

- **Fastener insertion:** Screws, rivets placed with 6-axis force control (Section 9.3)
- **Adhesive dispensing:** Robot positions parts while dispenser applies measured bead
- **Press-fit assembly:** Force-limited insertion prevents part damage (monitoring via current feedback)
