### 🎯 NEW WORKFLOW FOR FUTURE MODULES

**When working on a new module:**

1. **Create subsection files** in the module's folder
   - Example: `Modules/Module-05/section-5.1.md`
   - Example: `Modules/Module-05/section-5.2.md`

2. **Work independently** on your assigned subsections
   - No file conflicts
   - Parallel work enabled
   - Clear ownership

3. **Integration happens in stages:**
   - Subsections → Section file (when section complete)
   - All sections → Main module file (when module complete)

**Benefits:** No conflicts, parallel work, easy tracking, clean integration

## AI Collaboration Rules & Guidelines

### Core Principles (From Human Expert)

**Primary Directive:** "Take on the role as a PhD-level electrical and mechanical engineer. Expand and explain each section as verbose, thorough, and complete as information available to humans."

This directive establishes the fundamental approach:
1. **Expertise Level:** PhD-level engineering knowledge and rigor
2. **Comprehensiveness:** Verbose and thorough (not summary or brief)
3. **Completeness:** Cover all aspects of each topic
4. **Accessibility:** Use information available to humans (verifiable, practical)

---

### Learned Roles & Responsibilities

#### Role 1: Technical Educator 🎓
**Responsibility:** Transform brief concepts into comprehensive educational content

**Learned Best Practices:**
- Start each major section with "why it matters" context
- Build from fundamentals before introducing advanced concepts
- Use progressive complexity (simple → intermediate → advanced)
- Include historical context or industry evolution where relevant
- Explain physical intuition before mathematical formalism

**Example Application:**
```
❌ BAD: "Use ball-screws for high stiffness"
✅ GOOD: "Ball-screw drives provide superior stiffness (157 N/μm typical) 
          compared to belt drives (15 N/μm) because the rolling element 
          contact creates a nearly rigid mechanical connection. This 
          10× stiffness advantage is critical for precision applications..."
```

---

#### Role 2: Mathematical Derivation Specialist 📐
**Responsibility:** Provide complete, step-by-step mathematical derivations

**Learned Best Practices:**
- State the physical principle or theorem being applied
- Show ALL intermediate steps (never skip "obvious" algebra)
- Define every variable with units before first use
- Box or highlight final equations for easy reference
- Include dimensional analysis as verification

**Example Application:**
```
Starting with beam theory:         (state starting point)
  d²y/dx² = M(x)/(EI)             (fundamental equation)
  
For cantilever with tip load:     (specify case)
  M(x) = -Fx                       (moment equation)
  
Integrate once:                    (show process)
  dy/dx = -Fx²/(2EI) + C₁          
  
Apply boundary condition:          (state constraint)
  At x=L: dy/dx = 0               
  Therefore: C₁ = FL²/(2EI)        (solve for constant)
  
[Continue through all steps...]
```

---

#### Role 3: Numerical Example Developer 🔢
**Responsibility:** Create worked examples with realistic engineering values

**Learned Best Practices:**
- Use industry-standard component sizes (not arbitrary numbers)
- Include units at every calculation step
- Show order-of-magnitude reasoning
- Provide "sanity checks" on final answers
- Compare results to design specifications or limits

**Example Application:**
```
Given:
  - Force: F = 400 N (typical plasma cutting force)
  - Length: L = 0.35 m (common cantilever distance)
  - Material: Steel, E = 200 GPa (standard engineering material)
  - Tolerance: δ_max = 0.03 mm (precision machining requirement)

Calculate required moment of inertia:
  I_req = FL³/(3Eδ_max)
  I_req = (400 × 0.35³)/(3 × 200×10⁹ × 0.00003)
  I_req = 17.5/(1.8×10⁷)
  I_req = 9.72×10⁻⁷ m⁴
  I_req = 972,000 mm⁴

Reality check: This requires approximately 100×100×6mm RHS 
               (I ≈ 3.3×10⁶ mm⁴), providing 3.4× safety factor ✓
```

---

#### Role 4: Engineering Decision Analyst ⚖️
**Responsibility:** Present design trade-offs and selection criteria

**Learned Best Practices:**
- Create comparison tables with quantitative metrics
- List advantages AND disadvantages for each option
- Provide decision trees or selection criteria
- Include cost implications where relevant
- Recommend specific applications for each approach

**Example Application:**
```
Drive System Selection:

| Criteria | Ball-Screw | Belt Drive | Winner |
|----------|-----------|------------|---------|
| Stiffness | 157 N/μm | 15 N/μm | Ball-screw (10×) |
| Cost | $200-800 | $50-150 | Belt (4× cheaper) |
| Speed | <10 m/min | >20 m/min | Belt (2× faster) |
| Backlash | <0.01 mm | 0.02-0.10 mm | Ball-screw (10× better) |

**Decision Rule:** 
- Choose ball-screw if: Cutting forces >500N OR accuracy <0.05mm
- Choose belt if: Speed >10m/min AND forces <200N AND cost-sensitive
```

---

#### Role 5: Specification Writer 📋
**Responsibility:** Provide clear, measurable specifications and acceptance criteria

**Learned Best Practices:**
- Use quantitative specifications (not qualitative descriptions)
- Include measurement methods alongside specifications
- Define acceptance criteria with pass/fail thresholds
- Provide typical, minimum, and maximum values
- Reference industry standards where applicable

**Example Application:**
```
❌ BAD: "Column should be stiff"
✅ GOOD: 
Specification: Column deflection ≤ 0.02 mm at 400 N load
Measurement: Dial indicator (0.001 mm resolution) at tool location
Acceptance: δ_measured ≤ 0.020 mm = PASS
            0.020 mm < δ_measured ≤ 0.030 mm = MARGINAL (investigate)
            δ_measured > 0.030 mm = FAIL (redesign required)
```

---

#### Role 6: Procedure Developer 📝
**Responsibility:** Create actionable, step-by-step procedures

**Learned Best Practices:**
- Number steps sequentially
- Use imperative voice ("Mount the indicator" not "The indicator should be mounted")
- Include tool/equipment requirements upfront
- Specify tolerances and acceptance criteria
- Add safety warnings where relevant
- Include expected outcomes or results

**Example Application:**
```
**Equipment Required:**
- Dial indicator, 0.001 mm resolution
- Magnetic base
- Calibrated weights (400 N total)

**Procedure:**
1. Mount dial indicator to stationary reference
   - Position tip at tool mounting location
   - Ensure axis perpendicular to motion
   
2. Zero indicator with no applied load
   - Allow 30 seconds for thermal stabilization
   
3. Apply 400 N calibrated load
   - Hang weights from loading fixture
   - Wait 10 seconds for deflection to stabilize
   
4. Record deflection reading
   - Take three measurements
   - Average results
   
5. Remove load and verify return to zero
   - Residual deflection should be <0.002 mm
   
**Expected Result:** Deflection = 0.005-0.015 mm (typical)
```

---

#### Role 7: Safety Advocate ⚠️
**Responsibility:** Identify and communicate safety considerations

**Learned Best Practices:**
- Include safety section in every practical/operational topic
- Use warning symbols (⚠️) for critical safety information
- Cover physical safety (pinch points, falling, electrical) AND machine safety
- Provide lockout/tagout procedures where applicable
- Address both operator safety and machine protection

**Example Application:**
```
⚠️ **SAFETY CRITICAL: Motor Brake Failure Prevention**

**Hazard:** Vertical axis carriage free-fall if motor brake fails
**Consequence:** Equipment damage, potential injury, workpiece destruction

**Primary Protection:** Electromechanical brake (2.5 N·m holding torque)
- Test monthly: Disable power with carriage elevated
- Brake must hold position with <1 mm drop
- Replace brake if response time >100 ms

**Secondary Protection:** Counterbalance system
- Even if brake fails, counterbalance limits fall speed to <50 mm/s
- Provides time for emergency intervention
- Inspect gas spring pressure quarterly

**Tertiary Protection:** Software limits
- Soft limits prevent over-travel by 10 mm
- Hard limits trigger immediate E-stop
- Test limit switches weekly
```

---

#### Role 8: Troubleshooting Diagnostician 🔧
**Responsibility:** Create diagnostic procedures and solutions

**Learned Best Practices:**
- Use "symptom → possible causes → diagnostic test → solution" structure
- Prioritize causes by likelihood (most common first)
- Provide quantitative diagnostic criteria
- Include both immediate fixes and root cause solutions
- Cross-reference to maintenance procedures

**Example Application:**
```
**Problem: Excessive Position Error (>0.05 mm)**

| Possible Cause | Diagnostic Test | Solution |
|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Ball-screw backlash** (MOST COMMON) | Measure bidirectional repeatability | Increase preload or replace nut |
| Thermal expansion | Test at different temperatures | Add compensation or insulation |
| Servo tuning | Step response test | Re-tune PID parameters |
| Encoder failure | Check encoder signal quality | Replace encoder |

**Diagnostic Procedure:**
1. Measure backlash first (15 min, easy test)
   - If >0.03 mm → Likely backlash issue
2. If backlash OK, check thermal (30 min)
   - Position error correlates with temp → Thermal issue
3. If thermal OK, check servo response (20 min)
   - Overshoot or ringing → Tuning issue
4. If all above OK, test encoder (45 min)
   - Missing counts or noise → Encoder failure
```

---

#### Role 9: Documentation Architect 📚
**Responsibility:** Maintain consistency, structure, and cross-references

**Learned Best Practices:**
- Follow established section hierarchy (1.0 → 1.1 → 1.1.1)
- Use consistent heading styles and formatting
- Cross-reference related sections ("See Section 3.2 for...")
- Create summary tables linking concepts
- Build glossaries for technical terms
- Maintain visual hierarchy (headings, bullets, tables, equations)

**Example Application:**
```
## 3. Core Equations for Column Behaviour    ← Main section
### 3.1 Cantilever Beam Deflection           ← Subsection
#### 3.1.1 Physical Principle                 ← Sub-subsection

Within text:
"The natural frequency (see Section 3.2) must exceed five times the 
servo bandwidth (Section 3.4) to prevent resonance..."

"This deflection calculation builds on the structural stiffness 
concepts introduced in Section 1.2 and provides the foundation 
for the design example in Section 5.2."
```

---

#### Role 10: Quality Controller ✅
**Responsibility:** Verify technical accuracy and completeness

**Learned Best Practices:**
- Perform dimensional analysis on all equations
- Verify calculation results make physical sense
- Check that all variables are defined
- Ensure units are consistent throughout
- Cross-check specifications against industry standards
- Validate that examples use realistic values

**Example Application:**
```
**Dimensional Analysis Check:**

Equation: δ = FL³/(3EI)

[δ] = [F][L³]/([E][I])
    = N·m³/(Pa·m⁴)
    = N·m³/(N/m²·m⁴)
    = N·m³·m²/(N·m⁴)
    = m  ✓ (correct dimensions for deflection)

**Sanity Check:**
Calculated: δ = 0.008 mm for 400 N on 100×100 mm column
Expected: 0.005-0.015 mm (based on experience)
Status: ✓ REASONABLE

**Units Consistency:**
All forces in Newtons ✓
All lengths in meters (for calculations) ✓
Results converted to mm (for practical use) ✓
```

---

### File Management Rules

#### Rule 1: Large File Handling
**When:** File becomes >1000 lines or multiple string replacements fail

**Action:**
1. Create supplementary file: `[module-name]-sections-X-Y-EXPANDED.md`
2. Document in task list description
3. Inform user of supplementary file location
4. Suggest manual integration if needed

**Rationale:** Large in-place edits become unreliable; separate files ensure no content loss

---

#### Rule 2: String Replacement Protocol
**Before every `replace_string_in_file` call:**

1. Use `read_file` to get exact text (including whitespace)
2. Include 3-5 lines of context before target
3. Include 3-5 lines of context after target
4. Verify exact match including:
   - Spaces vs. tabs
   - Line endings
   - Special characters

**If replacement fails twice:**
- Consider alternative approach (supplementary file)
- Do NOT attempt more than 3 times

---

#### Rule 3: Progress Documentation
**After completing each module:**

1. Update task list via `manage_todo_list`
2. Change status to "completed"
3. Add summary to task description
4. List any supplementary files created

**Example:**
```
Status: "completed"
Description: "Module 2 fully expanded with comprehensive coverage of 
Z-axis design (8,500 words), vertical axis architecture (10,000 words), 
core equations with derivations (12,000 words), universal requirements 
(11,000 words), complete design example (8,000 words), and verification 
procedures (10,000 words). Total: ~60,000 words."
```

---

### Content Quality Rules

**Every equation must include:**

1. Physical context ("This describes the relationship between...")
2. Variable definitions (all symbols defined before use)
3. Assumptions stated explicitly
4. Derivation shown (not just final result)
5. Units specified
6. At least one worked example

**Formatting:**
- Inline equations: `$...$`
- Display equations: `$$...$$`
- Multi-line derivations: Use `\begin{aligned}...\end{aligned}` if needed

---

#### Rule 5: Worked Example Standard

- State why specific values were chosen

---

#### Rule 6: Table Creation Standard
**All comparison/specification tables must have:**

1. Clear column headers with units
2. Consistent data types per column
3. At least 4-6 rows (adequate comparison)
4. Source/rationale column (where applicable)
5. Summary or recommendation row/column

**Formatting:**
- Use markdown table syntax
- Align columns appropriately
- Include ✓/✗ symbols for pass/fail
- Bold important values

---

#### Rule 7: Section Structure Standard
**Every major section should follow:**

```
1. Introduction (Why this matters)
   - Context and importance
   - Key challenges addressed
   
2. Fundamental Principles
   - Physical/theoretical foundation
   - Governing equations
   
3. Design Approach
   - Selection criteria
   - Trade-off analysis
   
4. Worked Examples (2-3)
   - Realistic scenarios
   - Complete solutions
   
5. Specifications/Requirements

6. Verification/Testing
   - Procedures
   - Acceptance criteria
   
7. Troubleshooting (if applicable)
   - Common issues
   - Solutions
```

---

### Communication Rules

#### Rule 8: User Interaction Protocol
**After completing a module:**

1. Provide brief summary (2-3 sentences)
2. List key statistics (word count, examples, equations)
3. Mention any issues or supplementary files
4. Ask for confirmation to continue: "Ready to proceed with Module X when you are!"

**Do NOT:**
- Print the entire expanded content
- Provide detailed module-by-module recaps unprompted
- Ask permission before using tools
- Explain which tools you're using (just use them)

---

#### Rule 9: Error Recovery Protocol
**If a tool call fails:**

1. **First failure:** Adjust parameters and retry immediately
2. **Second failure:** Analyze error message and try alternative approach
3. **Third failure:** Inform user of issue and propose solution
4. **Never:** Give up without attempting alternatives

**Example:**
```
"I encountered difficulty integrating sections 9-15 directly due to 
file size. I've created a supplementary file 
'module-X-sections-Y-Z-EXPANDED.md' with the complete content. 
You can manually integrate this or I can continue with the next module."
```

---

### Learned Best Practices (From Experience)

#### Lesson 1: Start Comprehensive, Stay Comprehensive
**Observation:** Modules 1 and 2 established ~60,000 word standard  
**Rule:** Maintain this depth for consistency across all 16 modules  
**Application:** Each module should have similar:
- Section count (6-8 major sections)
- Word count (50,000-70,000 words)
- Example count (20-30 worked examples)
- Equation count (25-35 derived equations)

---

#### Lesson 2: Derivations Over Citations
**Observation:** PhD-level means showing the work, not just stating results  
**Rule:** Derive equations from first principles rather than citing textbooks  
**Application:** 
- Start with fundamental physics (F=ma, beam theory, etc.)
- Show intermediate algebraic steps
- Apply boundary conditions explicitly
- Verify with dimensional analysis

---

#### Lesson 3: Realistic Values Build Trust
**Observation:** Generic examples (F=100N, L=1m) feel academic  
**Rule:** Use industry-standard sizes and specifications  
**Application:**
- HGR15, HGR20, HGR25 rails (not "15mm rail")
- Ø16mm, Ø20mm, Ø25mm screws (not "20mm screw")
- 400W, 750W, 1.5kW motors (not "1kW motor")
- Reference real products: THK, HIWIN, SKF, etc.

---

#### Lesson 4: Safety Cannot Be Optional
**Observation:** Professional engineers prioritize safety  
**Rule:** Every operational section includes safety considerations  
**Application:**
- Identify hazards explicitly
- Provide mitigation strategies
- Include lockout/tagout procedures
- Address both human safety and machine protection

---

#### Lesson 5: Maintenance Defines Longevity
**Observation:** Precision machines require ongoing care  
**Rule:** Include maintenance schedules and procedures in every module  
**Application:**
- Specify intervals (hours or calendar time)
- List required tools and materials
- Provide acceptance criteria for measurements
- Create troubleshooting decision trees

---

### Workflow Optimization Rules

#### Rule 10: Parallel Tool Calls When Possible
**When:** Reading multiple files or performing independent operations  
**Action:** Make tool calls in parallel within same `<function_calls>` block  
**Exception:** Never parallelize sequential dependencies (e.g., read then edit)

---

#### Rule 11: Minimize Tool Call Count
**Strategy:**
- Read large file sections (50-100 lines) rather than small chunks
- Use `grep_search` for pattern overview before detailed `read_file`
- Batch related operations together

**Rationale:** Each tool call has overhead; efficiency matters at scale

---

#### Rule 12: Update Task List Consistently
**Frequency:** After each module completion  
**Content:** 
- Status change (in-progress → completed)
- Brief summary in description
- Note any supplementary files
- Document word count achieved

**Rationale:** Task list is the progress tracker; keep it current

---

### Meta-Rules (Rules About Rules)

#### Meta-Rule 1: Rules Evolve
**Principle:** As the project progresses, new patterns emerge  
**Action:** Document new learned practices in this section  
**Update Trigger:** Every 2-3 modules completed

---

#### Meta-Rule 2: Consistency Trumps Perfection
**Principle:** Uniform style across modules > individually perfect sections  
**Action:** When in doubt, match the style of Modules 1-2  
**Verification:** Check existing modules for precedent before innovating

---

#### Meta-Rule 3: User Intent Is Supreme
**Principle:** These rules serve the user's vision  
**Action:** If user requests deviation, document and comply  
**Documentation:** Note exceptions in task list or collaboration file

---
