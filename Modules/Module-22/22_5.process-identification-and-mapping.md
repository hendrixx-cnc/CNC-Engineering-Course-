## 22.5.1 Process Identification and Mapping

Before controlling processes, you must identify and understand them. Process mapping visualizes how work flows through the organization.

### Process Identification

**Process**: Set of interrelated activities that transform inputs into outputs

**Process Categories in CNC Manufacturing**:

**Core Processes** (directly create value):
- Sales and quoting
- Order processing
- Production planning and scheduling
- CNC programming
- Machine setup

## 22.5.3 Process Validation and Verification

**Verification**: Confirmation that specified requirements have been met ("Did we build it right?")

**Validation**: Confirmation that product meets user needs and intended use ("Did we build the right thing?")

### When Validation is Required

**ISO 9001 Clause 8.5.1.2**: Validation required when **output cannot be verified by subsequent measurement or monitoring** (i.e., defects not detectable until product in use).

**Special Processes** requiring validation:
- **Heat treatment**: Internal structure and properties not visible (must validate process capable of achieving requirements)
- **Welding**: Internal weld integrity not fully verifiable by visual inspection (X-ray or UT may be used, but process still validated)
- **Plating/coating**: Adhesion and coverage may not be fully verifiable (validate process parameters)
- **Cleaning**: Cleanliness level not always verifiable (validate cleaning process removes contaminants)
- **Sterilization** (medical devices): Sterility cannot be tested (destroys sample); validate sterilization cycle
- **Software**: Output depends on inputs and logic; validate through testing

**Non-Special Processes** (verification sufficient):
- Machining: Output fully measurable (dimensions, surface finish)
- Assembly: Visual and dimensional verification possible
- *However*, capability studies still valuable even if not "special processes"

### Process Validation Steps

**1. Define Process Requirements**:
- What must process achieve? (e.g., heat treatment: achieve Rc 40-44 hardness)
- Specifications and acceptance criteria

**2. Identify Process Parameters**:
- Variables affecting outcome (temperature, time, pressure, flow rate, etc.)
- Critical parameters vs. non-critical

**3. Establish Process Controls**:
- Equipment calibration and maintenance
- Procedures and work instructions
- Monitoring and recording methods

**4. Qualification of Equipment**:
- **Installation Qualification (IQ)**: Verify equipment installed correctly per specifications
- **Operational Qualification (OQ)**: Verify equipment operates per specifications across operational ranges
- **Performance Qualification (PQ)**: Verify process produces acceptable results consistently

**5. Process Performance Testing**:
- Run process with actual parts or representative samples
- Measure outputs and verify meet requirements
- Statistical sample size (typically 30+ samples for statistical confidence)

**6. Documentation**:
- Validation protocol (plan)
- Test results
- Analysis and conclusion
- Approval signatures

**7. Revalidation**:
- When process changes (equipment, materials, procedures)
- Periodic revalidation (annually or per schedule)
- After significant downtime or repairs

### Validation Example: Heat Treatment Process

**Process**: Stress relief heat treatment for aluminum parts (350°F for 3 hours)

**Validation Protocol**:

**1. Requirements**:
- Temperature: 350°F ±10°F
- Time: 3 hours minimum
- Verify stress relief effective (dimensional stability)

**2. Equipment**:
- Oven with calibrated temperature controller and recorder
- Thermocouples placed at multiple locations in oven (verify temperature uniformity)

**3. Installation Qualification (IQ)**:
- Verify oven installed per manufacturer specs
- Verify utilities connected (electrical, ventilation)
- Calibration of temperature controller and recorder verified

**4. Operational Qualification (OQ)**:
- Run oven empty at 350°F for 3 hours
- Record temperature at multiple locations (9 points in oven)
- Verify all locations within ±10°F of setpoint
- Result: Temperature uniformity acceptable

**5. Performance Qualification (PQ)**:
- Load oven with 30 parts (production configuration)
- Run cycle: Heat to 350°F, hold 3 hours, cool
- Measure hardness on sample parts (before and after treatment)
- Measure dimensional stability (re-measure parts after 30 days, verify no movement)
- Result: All parts meet hardness spec, no dimensional changes detected

**6. Validation Report**:
- Document IQ, OQ, PQ results
- Conclusion: Process validated for stress relief heat treatment
- Approval: Engineering and Quality Manager signatures

**7. Ongoing Control**:
- Each cycle: Record temperature and time (chart recorder or data logger)
- Periodic hardness checks (1 part per lot)
- Annual revalidation (OQ temperature uniformity check)

## 22.5.4 Special Processes (Welding, Heat Treatment, Plating)

Special processes require validated procedures, qualified equipment, and trained/certified personnel.

### Welding

**Why Special Process**:
- Weld quality (strength, integrity) depends on process parameters (current, voltage, speed, shielding gas)
- Internal defects (porosity, lack of fusion) not visible externally
- Destructive testing (tensile, bend) or NDT (X-ray, UT) required for verification

**Welding Controls**:

**1. Welding Procedures (WPS)**:
- **Welding Procedure Specification (WPS)**: Document specifying welding parameters
- Parameters: Base metal, filler metal, joint design, current, voltage, travel speed, preheat, post-weld heat treatment
- WPS developed and qualified per code (AWS, ASME, API)

**2. Procedure Qualification Record (PQR)**:
- Test record demonstrating WPS produces acceptable welds
- Sample welded per WPS, then tested (tensile, bend, impact, macro/micro examination)
- PQR supports WPS

**3. Welder Qualification**:

- Furnace: Class 2 per AMS 2750 (TUS every 6 months)
- Monitoring: Chart recorder captures temperature continuously
- Verification: Hardness test 3 locations on 1 sample part per load
- Certification: Heat treat cert lists load #, parts S/Ns, cycle parameters, hardness results (Rc 60, 61, 59)

### Plating and Coating

**Why Special Process**:
- Coating thickness, adhesion, coverage not always fully verifiable (especially complex geometries)
- Chemistry and process parameters critical (tank concentration, temperature, current density for electroplating)

**Plating Controls**:

**1. Plating Specifications**:
- Type of plating (zinc, nickel, chrome, anodize, etc.)
- Thickness requirement (e.g., 0.0005" min per QQ-N-290 for nickel)

## 22.5.5 Machine Qualification and Capability Studies

Capability studies quantify how well a manufacturing process can meet specifications. Essential for process qualification, continuous improvement, and customer requirements (PPAP, FAI).

### Machine vs. Process Capability

**Machine Capability (Cm, Cmk)**:
- Measures **machine's** inherent capability (short-term, ideal conditions)
- Factors affecting machine capability: Accuracy, repeatability, resolution
- Measured with: Same operator, same setup, short time period (minimal variation sources)

**Process Capability (Cp, Cpk)**:
- Measures **process** capability including all normal variation sources
- Includes: Machine, operator, material, environment, measurement
- Measured with: Production conditions over time

**Long-Term Process Performance (Pp, Ppk)**:
- Measures process performance over extended period (weeks, months)
- Includes: All variation sources plus long-term drift, seasonal effects, lot-to-lot material variation

### 22.5.5.1 Machine Capability Studies (Cm, Cmk)

**Machine Capability Study**: Evaluates machine's ability to produce parts within tolerance under ideal conditions

#### When to Conduct Machine Capability Study

- New machine purchase (acceptance test)
- After major machine repair or rebuild
- Periodic verification (annually)
- Qualifying machine for new job

#### Procedure for Machine Capability Study

**1. Setup**:
- Use best operator
- Stable, controlled environment (temperature controlled if applicable)
- One setup (no re-setups during study)
- Proven program and tooling
- Calibrated measurement equipment

**2. Sample Collection**:
- Produce 50-100 parts consecutively (no adjustments)
- Measure characteristic of interest (dimension, surface finish, etc.)
- Short time period (within 1-2 hours)

**3. Data Analysis**:
- Calculate mean (x̄) and standard deviation (σ)
- Calculate Cm and Cmk

#### Formulas

**Cm (Machine Capability Index)** - Measures spread of process relative to tolerance:

```
Cm = (USL - LSL) / (6σ)

Where:
USL = Upper Specification Limit
LSL = Lower Specification Limit
σ = Standard deviation of sample
```

**Cmk (Machine Capability Index accounting for centering)** - Measures capability considering how centered process is:

```
Cmk = min[(USL - x̄) / (3σ), (x̄ - LSL) / (3σ)]

Where:
x̄ = Process mean (average)
```

**Interpretation**:
- **Cmk ≥ 2.0**: Excellent machine capability (machine variation uses ≤50% of tolerance)
- **Cmk ≥ 1.67**: Good capability (machine acceptable for most applications)
- **Cmk ≥ 1.33**: Adequate (minimum for most customers)
- **Cmk < 1.33**: Inadequate (machine may not hold tolerance consistently)

#### Example Machine Capability Study

**Part**: Shaft diameter, specification .500" ± .002" (USL = .502", LSL = .498")

**Study**:
- Machined 50 parts consecutively, no adjustments
- Measured diameter on each part with micrometer

**Data Summary**:
- Mean (x̄) = .5005"
- Standard deviation (σ) = .0003"

**Calculate Cm**:
```
Cm = (.502 - .498) / (6 × .0003)
Cm = .004 / .0018
Cm = 2.22
```

**Calculate Cmk**:
```
Cmk = min[(.502 - .5005) / (3 × .0003), (.5005 - .498) / (3 × .0003)]
Cmk = min[.0015 / .0009, .0025 / .0009]
Cmk = min[1.67, 2.78]
Cmk = 1.67
```

**Conclusion**:
- Cm = 2.22 (excellent spread)
- Cmk = 1.67 (good capability, slightly off-center)
- **Machine capable** of meeting specification
- **Opportunity**: Center process better (adjust offset) to improve Cmk closer to Cm

### 22.5.5.2 Process Capability Studies (Cp, Cpk)

**Process Capability Study**: Evaluates entire manufacturing process (including all variation sources) under normal production conditions

#### When to Conduct Process Capability Study

- New product launch (PPAP requirement)
- After process change (new machine, tooling, material, method)
- Qualifying process for critical characteristics
- Continuous monitoring (SPC)

#### Procedure for Process Capability Study

**1. Stable Process**:
- Process must be in statistical control (no special causes)
- Run control chart to verify stability

**2. Sample Collection**:
- Collect 100-125 individual measurements (or 25-30 subgroups of 4-5)
- Over time representing normal production (multiple setups, operators, shifts)
- Shorter than long-term study (days to weeks, not months)

**3. Data Analysis**:
- Verify normality (histogram, normal probability plot)
- Calculate Cp and Cpk

#### Formulas

**Cp (Process Capability Index)**:

```
Cp = (USL - LSL) / (6σ)
```

**Cpk (Process Capability Index accounting for centering)**:

```
Cpk = min[(USL - x̄) / (3σ), (x̄ - LSL) / (3σ)]
```

*(Formulas identical to Cm/Cmk, but σ represents process variation including all sources)*

**Interpretation**:
- **Cpk ≥ 2.0**: Excellent process (Six Sigma level, <3.4 defects per million)
- **Cpk ≥ 1.67**: Good process (typical APQP target for critical characteristics)
- **Cpk ≥ 1.33**: Capable process (typical minimum requirement)
- **Cpk ≥ 1.0**: Marginally capable (99.73% of parts within spec, but little margin)
- **Cpk < 1.0**: Incapable (producing defects)

**Action Based on Cpk**:
- **Cpk ≥ 1.33**: Normal sampling inspection acceptable
- **1.0 ≤ Cpk < 1.33**: Increased inspection (100% or tighter sampling)
- **Cpk < 1.0**: Corrective action required; may need 100% inspection, sortation, or process improvement before continuing production

#### Example Process Capability Study

**Part**: Hole diameter, specification 10.00 mm ± 0.05 mm (USL = 10.05, LSL = 9.95)

**Study**:
- Collected 125 samples over 2 weeks (normal production)
- 3 operators, 2 machines, multiple setups

**Data Summary**:
- Mean (x̄) = 10.01 mm
- Standard deviation (σ) = 0.015 mm

**Calculate Cp**:
```
Cp = (10.05 - 9.95) / (6 × 0.015)
Cp = 0.10 / 0.09
Cp = 1.11
```

**Calculate Cpk**:
```
Cpk = min[(10.05 - 10.01) / (3 × 0.015), (10.01 - 9.95) / (3 × 0.015)]
Cpk = min[0.04 / 0.045, 0.06 / 0.045]
Cpk = min[0.89, 1.33]
Cpk = 0.89
```

**Conclusion**:
- Cp = 1.11 (marginal spread)
- Cpk = 0.89 (**incapable** – process producing defects)
- **Actions**:
  - **Immediate**: 100% inspection of this characteristic until process improved
  - **Short-term**: Center process (adjust offset from 10.01 to 10.00 to improve Cpk)
  - **Long-term**: Reduce variation (investigate causes: tool wear, machine repeatability, operator technique, material variation)

### 22.5.5.3 Long-Term Process Performance (Pp, Ppk)

**Long-Term Process Performance**: Measures process performance over extended period (months), capturing all sources of variation including long-term drift and changes

#### When to Use Pp, Ppk

- PPAP submissions (initial process study before full production)
- Pre-production or pilot runs
- Long-term monitoring and trending

#### Difference from Cp, Cpk

| Aspect | Cp, Cpk | Pp, Ppk |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Time Period | Days to weeks (short-term) | Weeks to months (long-term) |
| Variation Sources | Normal production variation | All variation including long-term drift, seasonal effects |
| Purpose | Assess process capability | Assess overall process performance |
| Standard Deviation | Within-subgroup (short-term σ) | Overall standard deviation |

**Typical Sequence**:
1. **Initial Study** (PPAP): Ppk from initial production (before process fully stabilized)
2. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Cpk from production over time (process should improve as it stabilizes)

#### Formulas

**Pp (Process Performance Index)**:

```
Pp = (USL - LSL) / (6σ_overall)
```

**Ppk (Process Performance Index accounting for centering)**:

```
Ppk = min[(USL - x̄) / (3σ_overall), (x̄ - LSL) / (3σ_overall)]
```

**σ_overall**: Overall standard deviation (calculated from all individual measurements, not within-subgroup)

**Interpretation**: Same as Cpk:
- Ppk ≥ 1.67 (APQP target for new processes)
- Ppk ≥ 1.33 (minimum capability)

#### Relationship Between Pp/Ppk and Cp/Cpk

**If process is stable and in control**:
- Pp ≈ Cp
- Ppk ≈ Cpk

**If Pp/Ppk significantly lower than Cp/Cpk**:
- Indicates long-term drift or instability
- Process shifting over time (tool wear, temperature changes, material variation)
- **Action**: Investigate and address long-term variation sources

### Improving Process Capability

**If Cpk < Target** (typically 1.33), improvement needed:

#### 1. Center the Process (Improves Cpk)

If Cp is acceptable but Cpk low:
- Process off-center (mean not at nominal)
- **Action**: Adjust process mean (offset in CNC program, setup adjustment)
- **Result**: Cpk increases toward Cp

**Example**:
- Target: 10.00 mm ± 0.05 mm
- Current: x̄ = 10.025 mm (off by +0.025 mm)
- **Adjustment**: Offset by -0.025 mm to center at 10.00 mm
- **Result**: Cpk improves

#### 2. Reduce Variation (Improves Both Cp and Cpk)

If Cp is inadequate:
- Process variation too large relative to tolerance
- **Actions**:
  - **Machine**: Check machine accuracy (ballbar, laser calibration), improve rigidity, reduce thermal drift
  - **Tooling**: Better tool holders (hydraulic, shrink-fit vs. collet), tighter runout, replace worn tools sooner
  - **Fixturing**: Improve work holding (reduce deflection, better location)
  - **Material**: Tighter control of incoming material (reduce hardness variation, better stock dimensions)
  - **Operator**: Standardize setup procedures, training, reduce variation between operators
  - **Measurement**: Improve measurement system (Gage R&R), reduce measurement variation
  - **Environment**: Control temperature (especially for precision work), reduce vibration

**Example**:
- Cp = 0.90 (inadequate)
- Investigation finds tool runout excessive (.003" TIR)
- **Action**: Replace tool holder with hydraulic holder (runout <.0002")
- **Result**: σ reduced, Cp and Cpk improve to 1.5

#### 3. Widen Tolerance (Last Resort)

If process cannot be improved:
- Request engineering tolerance revision (if function allows)
- Change to more capable process (different machine, method)
- **Note**: Widening tolerance reduces quality level; only acceptable if function not compromised

### Capability Study Documentation

**Capability Study Report Should Include**:
- Part number, drawing number, characteristic studied
- Specification (USL, LSL, nominal)
- Sample size and collection period
- Data summary (mean, standard deviation, min, max)
- Histogram (shows distribution)
- Normal probability plot (verifies normality)
- Cp, Cpk (or Pp, Ppk) calculations
- Control chart (X-bar/R or Individuals) showing stability
- Conclusion (capable or incapable)
- Actions (if incapable)
- Approval signatures

**Software Tools**:
- Minitab (industry standard for statistical analysis)
- JMP
- Excel with statistical add-ins
- QC software (InfinityQS, etc.)

## 22.5.6 Setup Approval and First-Off Inspection

**Setup Approval**: Verification that machine setup is correct before running production, preventing production of nonconforming parts.

### Purpose of First-Off Inspection

**Benefits**:
- Catches setup errors early (work offset, tool length, fixture alignment, wrong program)
- Prevents scrap (costly to scrap entire lot)
- Reduces rework
- Verifies process under control before production
- Required by most quality systems (ISO 9001, AS9100, IATF 16949)

**Cost of Skipping First-Off**:
- Example: 100-piece lot, $50 material per piece, setup error causes all 100 scrapped = $5,000 scrap + labor + schedule impact
- First-off inspection cost: 30 minutes inspector time (~$30) → **Massive ROI**

### First-Off Inspection Procedure

**1. Operator Completes Setup**:
- Install tooling, fixtures, work offsets per setup sheet
- Load program
- Verify program number matches work order

**2. Operator Runs First Part**:
- Machine one complete part (or small batch if setup requires multiple parts)
- Perform basic checks:
  - Visual: All features machined? Obvious errors?
  - Key dimensions: Quick check with calipers or gage (not full inspection)

**3. Operator Submits to Inspection**:
- Deliver first-off part, traveler, and drawing to Inspection
- Production on hold until approval

**4. Inspector Performs Inspection**:
- Retrieve applicable drawing and control plan
- Measure characteristics per control plan:
  - **Critical characteristics**: 100% (all critical dimensions/features)
  - **Major characteristics**: Representative sample
  - **Minor characteristics**: Spot check
- Record results on traveler or inspection report

**5. Approval or Rejection**:
- **If ALL measurements within tolerance**:
  - Inspector approves (stamps "APPROVED" or signs traveler)
  - Operator proceeds with production
- **If ANY measurement out of tolerance**:
  - Inspector rejects (stamps "REJECTED")
  - Inspector notifies operator and supervisor
  - Operator adjusts setup
  - Repeat process (Steps 2-5)

**6. Documentation**:
- Inspection results retained (on traveler, in inspection log, or electronic record)
- Setup approval signature

### Setup Approval Frequency

**When Setup Approval Required**:
- **Every setup** (most conservative, recommended for critical parts)
- **New job or part** (first time running)
- **After tool change** (if tool change affects critical dimensions)
- **After significant downtime** (machine off overnight or longer)
- **When process unstable** (history of setup errors)

**Reduced First-Off** (if process proven stable):
- Visual and basic check by operator
- Full inspection periodic (every 5th setup, weekly, etc.)
- Risk-based approach (low-risk parts, proven processes, experienced operators)

### Setup Approval Documentation

**Traveler / Router**:
- Job tracking document that follows part through manufacturing
- Includes section for first-off inspection results

**Example Traveler Section**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ FIRST-OFF INSPECTION                                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

## Summary

Process control and validation ensure manufacturing processes consistently produce conforming products. Process mapping identifies activities and interactions. KPIs measure performance and drive improvement. Capability studies quantify process performance relative to specifications. Special processes require validation to ensure outputs meet requirements. Setup approval prevents costly scrap by verifying setup correctness before production.

Effective process control balances rigor with practicality, focusing resources on critical characteristics and processes while avoiding over-control of stable, capable processes. Data-driven decision making (capability indices, SPC, KPIs) enables continuous improvement and builds customer confidence.

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Create a Process Map

Create a process flow diagram for a CNC machining job from order to shipment:
1. List all major steps
2. Identify decision points
3. Draw flowchart with appropriate symbols
4. Identify potential bottlenecks or problem areas

### Exercise 2: Select and Define KPIs

For your shop (or hypothetical shop), select 5 key KPIs:
1. Define each KPI (formula, purpose)
2. Set realistic targets
3. Determine measurement frequency
4. Assign ownership (who monitors, who acts)
5. Describe how you would display KPIs (dashboard design)

### Exercise 3: Conduct a Capability Study

Perform a simplified capability study on a process:
1. Select a dimension or characteristic
2. Collect 30 measurements (from existing data or measure actual parts)
3. Calculate mean and standard deviation (use Excel AVERAGE and STDEV functions)
4. Calculate Cp and Cpk (use formulas)
5. Interpret results: Is process capable? What actions needed?

**Example Calculation**:
- Spec: 25.0 ± 0.1 mm (USL=25.1, LSL=24.9)
- Data: Measure 30 parts
- Mean (x̄) = 25.02 mm
- Std Dev (σ) = 0.025 mm
- Cp = (25.1 - 24.9) / (6 × 0.025) = 0.2 / 0.15 = 1.33
- Cpk = min[(25.1 - 25.02)/(3×0.025), (25.02-24.9)/(3×0.025)] = min[1.07, 1.60] = 1.07
