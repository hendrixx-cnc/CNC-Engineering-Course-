# Module 16 – CAD Design for Manufacturable Parts

## 1. Introduction

CAD (Computer-Aided Design) is the foundation for manufacturable CNC parts. Good CAD practices ensure parts are accurate, cost-effective, and compatible with downstream CAM and fabrication processes.

## 2. Design for Manufacturability (DFM)

- Minimize complex features that require specialized tooling.
- Use standard hole sizes and fillets for ease of machining.
- Design with tolerances appropriate to process capabilities.

## 3. Parametric Modeling

- Use constraints and parameters for scalable designs.
- Create master sketches for robust part families.
- Link dimensions to global variables for easy updates.

## 4. Drawing & Detailing

- Dimension critical features and reference datums.
- Include material specs, finish, and tolerances.
- Export drawings as PDF
