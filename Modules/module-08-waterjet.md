# Module 8 – Water-Jet Cutting Systems

## 1. Introduction

Water-jet cutting uses a high-pressure stream of water, often mixed with abrasive particles, to cut metals, stone, glass, and composites. It offers cold cutting with no heat-affected zone.

## 2. Pump Types

- **Intensifier pumps**: Generate 50,000–90,000 psi using hydraulic pistons.
- **Direct-drive pumps**: Simpler, lower pressure, suitable for light-duty systems.

## 3. Cutting Head

- Sapphire or diamond orifice focuses water jet.
- Mixing tube introduces abrasive (garnet most common).
- Nozzle design affects kerf width and cut speed.

## 4. Abrasive System

- Garnet abrasive delivered via hopper and metering valve.
- Abrasive flow rate adjusted for material and thickness.
- Monitor for clogs and replace worn tubing.

## 5. Table Design

- Slat bed supports workpiece; allows water drainage.
- Water tank below for splash containment and noise suppression.
- Removable trays for spent abrasive collection.

## 6. CNC Integration

- Z axis controls standoff height (≈2–4 mm).
- Pump and valve control via digital relay from CNC.
- Program pierce delay, cut speed, and lead-in/out in CAM.

## 7. Cut Quality Factors

- **Pierce delay**: Prevents splash and incomplete penetration.
- **Cut speed**: Too fast = taper and rough edge; too slow = excessive kerf.
- **Kerf width**: Depends on nozzle and abrasive; offset in CAM.
- **Taper angle**: Minimized by optimal speed and standoff.

## 8. Safety

- Shielded enclosure to contain jet and abrasive.
- Wear hearing protection and safety goggles.
- High-voltage interlocks for pump and valve.

## 9. Maintenance

- Replace orifice and mixing tube regularly.
- Clean pump filters and check seals.
- Dispose of spent abrasive in accordance with regulations.

## 10. Troubleshooting

- Loss of pressure: Inspect pump and hoses.
- Poor cut quality: Change orifice, adjust abrasive flow.
- Clogs: Clear nozzle and mixing tube.

## 11. Conclusion

Water-jet cutting provides versatile, cold processing for diverse materials. Maintain pumps and consumables, optimize CNC programming, and operate safely for best results.
