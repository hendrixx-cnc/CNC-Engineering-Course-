# Module 24 – L.E.A.N. Strategies for CNC Manufacturing


## 24.8.1 Cell Design Principles

**Manufacturing Cell:** A group of workstations, machines, or processes arranged in a sequence to produce a product or family of products with minimal material handling and waiting.

### Core Concept

**Traditional Layout (Functional/Process):**
```
All Lathes    All Mills    All Grinders    Assembly
[L][L][L]     [M][M][M]    [G][G][G]      [A][A][A]
    ↓             ↓             ↓              ↓
 Parts travel long distances between departments
 Large batches, high WIP, complex scheduling
```

**Cellular Layout (Product/Flow):**
```
Cell 1 (Shaft Family):        Cell 2 (Housing Family):
L → M → G → A                  M → D → T → A
(Lathe, Mill, Grind, Assy)    (Mill, Drill, Tap, Assy)
    ↓                              ↓
 Parts flow through cell with minimal movement
 Small batches or one-piece flow, low WIP
```

### Key Principles

**1. Product Family Focus:**
- Cell dedicated to specific product family
- Similar processing requirements
- Common routing sequence

**2. Process Completeness:**
- All operations needed for product family
- Minimal handoffs to other areas
- "One-stop shop" for that family

**3. Spatial Proximity:**
- Machines close together (feet, not yards)
- Minimize walking and material handling
- Facilitates communication

**4. Flow Orientation:**
- Equipment arranged in processing sequence
- Linear or U-shaped flow
- No backtracking

**5. Operator Flexibility:**
- Multi-process handling (one operator, multiple machines)
- Cross-trained workers
- Variable staffing based on demand

**6. Built-In Quality:**
- Inspection integrated into cell
- Immediate feedback on defects
- Self-inspection by operator

**7. Visual Management:**
- Status visible at a glance
- Kanban signals
- Performance metrics displayed

## 24.8.2 Benefits of Manufacturing Cells

### Lead Time Reduction

**Before Cells (Functional Layout):**
- Part travels between departments
- Queue time at each operation
- Typical lead time: Days to weeks

**After Cells:**
- Part flows through cell continuously
- Minimal queue time
- Lead time: Hours to days (or minutes!)

**Example:**
- Functional layout lead time: 12 days
- Cellular layout lead time: 1 day
- **92% reduction!**

### Inventory Reduction

**Before Cells:**
- Large batches (justify setup, transportation)
- WIP everywhere (between operations, departments)
- High inventory carrying costs

**After Cells:**
- Small batches or one-piece flow
- Minimal WIP (only what's in process)
- Low inventory

**Example:**
- Functional WIP: 500 pieces
- Cellular WIP: 20 pieces
- **96% reduction!**

### Quality Improvement

**Before Cells:**
- Defects discovered days after creation
- Large batch affected
- Difficult to determine root cause (time lag)

**After Cells:**
- Defects discovered immediately (next operation)
- Small quantity affected
- Easy root cause analysis (just happened)
- Quick corrective action

**Example:**
- Functional defect rate: 3%
- Cellular defect rate: 0.5%
- **83% improvement!**

### Flexibility

**Before Cells:**
- Large batches = committed to product for long time
- Changeovers complex (entire department)
- Slow response to customer changes

**After Cells:**
- Small batches = quick product changes
- Changeovers localized (one cell)
- Fast response to demand

### Space Utilization

**Before Cells:**
- Equipment spread across facility
- Wide aisles for material handling
- Storage areas for WIP

**After Cells:**
- Compact footprint (operations close)
- Minimal aisles (hand-off vs. forklift)
- Little WIP storage needed

**Typical space reduction: 30-50%**

### Employee Engagement

**Before Cells:**
- Single-task jobs (boring, repetitive)
- No ownership (just one step of many)
- Disconnect from final product

**After Cells:**
- Multi-tasking (variety, interesting)
- Cell ownership (team responsible for output)
- See complete product (satisfaction)

**Result: Higher morale, lower turnover**

### Simplified Scheduling

**Before Cells:**
- Schedule each operation independently
- Complex MRP/ERP
- Expediting common

**After Cells:**
- Schedule cell (one point)
- Simple pull system
- Self-regulating flow

## 24.8.3 Cell Layout Options

### 24.8.3.1 U-Shaped Cells

**Most common and versatile cell design.**

**Configuration:**
```
    Inlet ↓                    ↑ Outlet
        ┌──────────────────┐
        │                  │
   Op1  │                  │  Op5
        │    Operator      │
   Op2  │    walks in      │  Op4
        │    center        │
   Op3  └──────────────────┘
```

**Characteristics:**

**Inlet/Outlet Close Together:**
- Easy material delivery
- Easy finished goods pickup
- Communication with upstream/downstream
- Supervisor visibility

**Operator in Center:**
- Short walking distances
- Can see all machines
- Hear problems (audio feedback)
- Efficient movement

**Compact Footprint:**
- Minimal space
- All operations visible
- Team communication easy

**Flexibility:**
- Add/remove operators based on demand
- 1 operator for low volume
- 2-3 operators for high volume

**Benefits:**
- Shortest walking distance
- Best communication
- Most flexible staffing
- Highest quality (visibility)

**When to Use:**
- Most applications
- 3-8 operations
- Multi-process handling
- Variable demand

### 24.8.3.2 L-Shaped Cells

**Variation when space or operations dictate.**

**Configuration:**
```
    Inlet ↓
        ┌──────────┐
   Op1  │          │
        │          │
   Op2  │          │
        │          │
   Op3  │          └───────────┐
        │                      │
        │  Operator            │  Op5
        │  workspace           │
        │                      │  Op4
        │                      │
        └──────────────────────┘
                            ↑ Outlet
```

**When to Use:**
- Space constraints (corner location)
- Fewer operations (3-5)
- Operations physically separate naturally
- Existing building limitations

**Trade-offs:**
- Longer walking than U
- Inlet/outlet not as close
- Still better than straight line

### 24.8.3.3 Straight-Line Cells

**Linear arrangement of operations.**

**Configuration:**
```
Inlet → [Op1] → [Op2] → [Op3] → [Op4] → [Op5] → Outlet

         Operator walks linear path
```

**When to Use:**
- Large parts (not easily turned)
- Heavy parts (crane/conveyor moves)
- Very few operations (2-3)
- Paced line (automotive-style)

**Benefits:**
- Simple flow (easy to understand)
- Good for large/heavy parts
- Can use conveyors

**Drawbacks:**
- Longest walking distance
- Inlet/outlet far apart
- Less flexible staffing
- More space required

**Variations:**

**Serpentine (Folded Straight):**
```
Inlet → [Op1] → [Op2] → [Op3]
                           ↓
               [Op6] ← [Op5] ← [Op4]
                  ↓
               Outlet
```
- Saves space vs. pure straight
- Inlet/outlet closer

---

## 24.8.4 Multi-Process Handling

**One operator managing multiple machines/processes.**

### Concept

**Traditional (One Operator, One Machine):**
- Operator loads part
- Waits while machine runs
- Unloads part
- **Operator utilization: 30-40%** (rest is waiting)

**Multi-Process Handling:**
- Operator loads machine 1, starts cycle
- While machine 1 runs, operator works on machine 2
- While machine 2 runs, operator works on machine 3
- Returns to machine 1 (cycle complete), unloads
- Continuous loop

**Operator utilization: 80-90%**

### Walking Pattern

**U-Cell Example (3 machines):**
```
    Material In
         ↓
    [Machine 1]
         ↓ (operator walks)
    [Machine 2]
         ↓ (operator walks)
    [Machine 3]
         ↓ (operator walks back to Machine 1)
    [Machine 1] (cycle complete, unload/reload)
         ↓
    Parts Out
```

**Operator Loop Time = Sum of manual work at each machine**

### Balancing Multi-Process

**Goal: Operator loop time ≤ Longest machine cycle time**

**Example:**

| Machine | Cycle Time | Manual Work (Load/Unload) |
|---------|------------|---------------------------|
| Lathe   | 5 min      | 0.5 min                   |
| Mill    | 7 min      | 1.0 min                   |
| Grind   | 4 min      | 0.5 min                   |

**Operator loop time:** 0.5 + 1.0 + 0.5 + walking (0.5 min) = **2.5 min**

**Longest cycle:** Mill = 7 min

**Result: Operator can manage 3 machines**
- Start lathe, walk to mill (lathe running)
- Start mill, walk to grind (lathe + mill running)
- Start grind, walk to lathe (all running)
- Lathe done (5 min), unload/reload (lathe still has 2 min before mill done)
- Mill done (7 min), unload/reload
- Grind done, unload/reload
- Return to lathe

**Continuous flow with one operator!**

### When Multi-Process Doesn't Work

**Operator loop time > machine cycle time:**
- Machines sit idle waiting for operator
- Need to reduce manual work or add operator

**Safety concerns:**
- Can't leave machines unattended
- Regulatory requirements
- Requires automation/guards

**High-attention processes:**
- Manual welding, inspection
- Can't multi-task

---

## 24.8.5 Cell Balancing and Staffing

### Takt Time Balancing

**Goal: Cell output matches customer demand (takt time).**

**Takt Time = Available time ÷ Customer demand**

**Example:**
- Available time: 450 min/day
- Demand: 150 parts/day
- **Takt time: 3 minutes per part**

**Cell must output one part every 3 minutes.**

### Balancing Operations

**Cell Operations:**

| Operation | Cycle Time | Status vs. Takt (3 min) |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------|
| Op 1      | 2.5 min    | OK (< takt)             |
| Op 2      | 4.0 min    | **Over takt** (bottleneck) |
| Op 3      | 1.5 min    | OK                      |
| Op 4      | 2.0 min    | OK                      |

**Op 2 is bottleneck** (can't keep up with takt).

**Balancing Options:**

**1. Improve Bottleneck:**
- Better tooling (reduce cycle time to 3 min or less)
- Split operation (part of work to Op 1 or 3)

**2. Add Capacity:**
- Second machine for Op 2
- Two machines feed one Op 3

**3. Offload Work:**
- Can some of Op 2 work move to another operation?

**Balanced Cell:**

| Operation | Revised Cycle Time |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Op 1      | 2.8 min (added work from Op 2) |
| Op 2      | 2.9 min (improved + offloaded) |
| Op 3      | 2.2 min (added work from Op 2) |
| Op 4      | 2.0 min           |

**All operations ≤ takt time = balanced**

### Variable Staffing

**Adjust operators based on demand.**

**Low Demand (Takt = 6 min):**
- 1 operator runs entire cell
- Multi-process handling
- Slower pace acceptable

**Medium Demand (Takt = 3 min):**
- 2 operators
- Each handles 2-3 machines
- Medium pace

**High Demand (Takt = 1.5 min):**
- 4 operators
- One per operation
- Fast pace

**Requires:**
- Cross-training (all operators can do all jobs)
- Flexible workforce
- Standard work for each configuration

## 24.8.6 Designing CNC Machining Cells

### 24.8.6.1 Equipment Selection for Cells

**Right-Size Equipment:**

**Traditional Thinking:**
- Buy largest, fastest machine possible
- Maximize capability
- Share across many products

**Cellular Thinking:**
- Buy machine sized for product family
- Dedicated to cell
- Maximize flow, not capability

**Example:**

**Product Family: Small shafts (1-3" diameter)**

**Traditional:** Buy large lathe (12" capacity)
- Can handle anything (over-capable for shafts)
- Expensive
- Large footprint
- Shared resource (scheduling complexity)

**Cellular:** Buy small lathe (4" capacity)
- Right-sized for shaft family
- Less expensive
- Compact (fits in cell)
- Dedicated (no scheduling conflict)
- Faster setup (simpler)

**Benefits of Right-Sizing:**
- Lower cost (can afford multiple smaller machines)
- Smaller footprint (fits in cell)
- Faster setup (simpler machines)
- Dedicated (no sharing)
- Easier to move (layout flexibility)

### 24.8.6.2 Automation in Cells

**Goal: Automation supports flow, not replaces operators.**

**Appropriate Automation:**

**1. Part Loading/Unloading:**
- Robotic load/unload if consistent family
- Frees operator for next operation
- Enables multi-process handling

**2. In-Process Measurement:**
- Probes, gages in machine
- Immediate feedback
- Prevents defects

**3. Material Handling Between Operations:**
- Conveyors, chutes, gravity feed
- Minimal operator effort
- Continuous flow

**4. Tool Changing:**
- Automatic tool changers (standard on CNC)
- Minimizes manual tool handling

**Avoid Over-Automation:**
- Lights-out manufacturing in cell (usually wrong)
- Flexibility lost (can't handle family variation)
- Very expensive
- Reliability issues (complex)
- Operator disengagement

**Right Balance:**
- Automate repetitive, non-value tasks
- Operator focuses on quality, problem-solving, improvement
- Flexible automation (handles family variations)

### 24.8.6.3 Quality at the Source

**Build Quality into Cell:**

**Poka-Yoke (Error Proofing):**
- Fixtures prevent incorrect loading
- Sensors detect missing operations
- Go/no-go gages at each operation
- *Detailed in Section 24.9*

**Self-Inspection:**
- Operator inspects own work
- Gages at point-of-use
- Standard work includes inspection

**Immediate Feedback:**
- Next operation checks previous operation
- Defects caught within minutes
- Stop and fix immediately

**Andon (Visual Alert):**
- Operator signals for help
- Light or buzzer
- Response within minutes

**Statistical Process Control (SPC):**
- Monitor critical dimensions
- Control charts at machine
- Operator adjusts before drift

**Result: Quality Built In, Not Inspected In**

## 24.8.8 Transitioning from Batch to Cells

**Challenge: Moving from functional layout to cells is disruptive.**

### Implementation Approach

**Phase 1: Pilot Cell (Weeks 1-8)**

**Select Product Family:**
- High volume or problem product
- Manageable scope (3-5 operations)
- Team capability

**Design Cell:**
- Map current state (functional layout)
- Design future state (cell layout)
- Simulate/test on paper

**Implement:**
- Move equipment (might be weekend)
- Connect utilities
- Test operation

**Prove Concept:**
- Run for 4-8 weeks
- Measure results vs. functional
- Refine

**Phase 2: Expand (Months 3-6)**

**Document Success:**
- Lead time reduction
- Inventory reduction
- Quality improvement
- Use data to build support

**Second Cell:**
- Another product family
- Apply lessons learned
- Faster implementation

**Third Cell:**
- Continue expansion
- Build momentum

**Phase 3: Full Implementation (Months 6-18)**

**Multiple Cells Operating:**
- Most product families in cells
- Remaining equipment in functional area (shared resources)
- Organization transformed

### Common Challenges

**Resistance to Change:**
- "We've always done it this way"
- Fear of job loss
- Comfort with current state

**Solution:** Involve operators early, communicate benefits, no-layoff commitment

**Equipment Moving Costs:**
- Rigging, electrical, install
- Can be expensive

**Solution:** Start with pilot (prove ROI first), phase approach

**Shared Resources:**
- Some equipment serves multiple families (heat treat, painting)
- Can't dedicate to one cell

**Solution:** Supermarket before/after shared process, pull system

**Balancing:**
- Difficult to balance all operations perfectly
- Some operations slower/faster

**Solution:** Continuous improvement, flexibility, accept imperfection initially

**Training:**
- Operators need multi-skilling
- Takes time to cross-train

**Solution:** Training plan, pair experienced with new, patience

### Typical Results

**Pilot Cell (4-8 weeks):**
- Lead time: 50-70% reduction
- WIP: 60-80% reduction
- Quality: 30-50% improvement
- Space: 20-40% reduction

**Full Implementation (12-18 months):**
- Lead time: 70-90% reduction
- Inventory: 50-75% reduction
- Quality: 50-80% improvement
- Productivity: 20-40% improvement

**ROI: Typically < 12 months**

## Summary

Cellular manufacturing groups operations by product family in close proximity for continuous flow. U-shaped cells are most common, enabling short walking distances and flexible staffing. Multi-process handling allows one operator to manage multiple machines efficiently.

Cells deliver dramatic improvements: 50-90% lead time reduction, 60-80% inventory reduction, 30-50% quality improvement. Cell performance metrics focus on flow (cycle time, WIP) rather than traditional efficiency. Transitioning from functional layout to cells should be phased: pilot cell first, prove results, then expand.

CNC machining cells use right-sized equipment, appropriate automation, and built-in quality. The result is faster response, lower inventory, better quality, and higher employee engagement.
