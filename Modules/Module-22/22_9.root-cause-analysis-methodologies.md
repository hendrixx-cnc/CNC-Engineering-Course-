## 22.9.1 Root Cause Analysis Methodologies

**Root Cause**: The fundamental reason a problem occurred; eliminating the root cause prevents recurrence

**Symptoms vs. Root Causes**:
- **Symptom**: Shaft diameter out of tolerance
- **Immediate Cause**: Tool worn
- **Root Cause**: No tool life tracking system in place

### 22.9.1.1 5 Whys Analysis

**5 Whys**: Simple technique asking "Why?" repeatedly to drill down to root cause

**Process**:
1. State the problem
2. Ask "Why did this happen?"
3. For each answer, ask "Why?" again
4. Repeat 5 times (or until root cause identified)
5. Root cause reached when asking "Why?" no longer provides useful information

**Example 1: Part Scrapped Due to Dimension Error**

```
Problem: Shaft diameter .510" (spec .500±.002")

Why? Tool wore beyond life
  Why? Operator didn't change tool when due
    Why? Operator didn't know tool life limit
      Why? No tool life tracking system
        Why? Management didn't implement tracking system (cost, priority)

ROOT CAUSE: No tool life tracking system implemented
```

**Corrective Action**: Implement tool life tracking in ERP; establish tool replacement intervals based on testing; train operators

**Example 2: Late Delivery**

```
Problem: Order shipped 3 days late

Why? Machining took longer than planned
  Why? Machine broke down mid-job
    Why? Spindle bearing failed
      Why? Preventive maintenance not performed
        Why? Maintenance schedule not followed (technician out sick, no backup)

ROOT CAUSE: No backup plan for preventive maintenance when technician unavailable
```

**Corrective Action**: Cross-train additional technician on preventive maintenance; implement maintenance scheduling system with alerts

**5 Whys Best Practices**:
- Don't stop too early (symptoms, not root cause)
- Don't go too far (beyond organization's control)
- Involve people who know the process
- Focus on process/system, not blame individuals
- Verify root cause (will eliminating it prevent recurrence?)

### 22.9.1.2 Fishbone (Ishikawa) Diagrams

**Fishbone Diagram**: Visual tool organizing potential causes into categories

**Categories (6 Ms)**:
- **M**achine (equipment, tools)
- **M**ethod (processes, procedures)
- **M**aterial (raw materials, supplies)
- **M**anpower (people, training, skill)
- **M**easurement (gages, inspection methods)
- **M**other Nature (environment: temperature, humidity, vibration)

**Example Fishbone Diagram**: Shaft Diameter Out of Tolerance

```
              Machine                    Method
                 |                          |
       Worn spindle bearings    No setup verification procedure
       Inadequate rigidity      Work offset entered incorrectly
                 |                          |
                 └──────────┬───────────────┘
                            │
                            │ Problem:
                         ┌──┴──┐ Diameter
                         │  ?  │ Out of Spec
                         └──┬──┘
                            │
                 ┌──────────┴───────────────┐
                 |                          |
            Material                   Measurement
                 |                          |
       Hardness variation          Micrometer out of cal
       Stock diameter inconsistent Gage R&R inadequate
                 |                          |
           Manpower                  Environment
                 |                          |
       Operator inexperienced        Temperature fluctuation
       No training on setup          Vibration from nearby press
```

**Process**:
1. Define problem (head of fish)
2. Draw main bones (6 M categories)
3. Brainstorm potential causes for each category
4. Ask "Why?" for each cause to dig deeper
5. Identify most likely root causes (circle or mark)
6. Verify root causes with data or testing

**Advantages**:
- Structured brainstorming
- Considers multiple categories (avoids tunnel vision)
- Visual representation easy to understand
- Good for complex problems with multiple contributing factors

### 22.9.1.3 Fault Tree Analysis

**Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)**: Top-down, deductive analysis using Boolean logic to identify combinations of failures leading to problem

**Logic Gates**:
- **AND Gate**: All inputs must occur for output to occur
- **OR Gate**: Any input causes output

**Example Fault Tree**: Shaft Scrapped (Oversized Diameter)

```
                Shaft Scrapped
                (Diameter > .502")
                      |
                   [OR Gate]
              __________|__________
              |                   |
         Tool Worn           Setup Error
              |                   |
          [AND Gate]          [OR Gate]
         _____|_____        _____|_____
         |         |        |         |
    Tool Life  Operator  Wrong    Work Offset
    Exceeded   Didn't    Tool     Wrong
               Replace   Selected
```

**Interpretation**:
- Shaft scrapped if EITHER tool worn OR setup error
- Tool worn requires BOTH tool life exceeded AND operator didn't replace
- Setup error from EITHER wrong tool selected OR work offset wrong

**Use Cases**:
- Complex systems with multiple failure modes
- Safety-critical applications (identify single points of failure)
- Understanding interactions between failures

**Advantages**:
- Rigorous, logical analysis
- Identifies combinations of failures
- Quantitative (can assign probabilities to estimate overall failure rate)

**Disadvantages**:
- Time-consuming for complex systems
- Requires understanding of system

### 22.9.1.4 Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)

**FMEA**: Systematic method for identifying potential failure modes, their effects, and prioritizing corrective actions

**FMEA Types**:
- **Design FMEA (DFMEA)**: Identifies design weaknesses
- **Process FMEA (PFMEA)**: Identifies process risks

**FMEA Process (for PFMEA)**:

**1. Identify Process Steps**: List operations in manufacturing process

**2. Identify Potential Failure Modes**: What could go wrong at each step?
- Dimensional error
- Surface damage
- Wrong material
- Missing operation

**3. Identify Effects**: What happens if failure occurs?
- Scrap part
- Customer complaint
- Field failure
- Safety hazard

**4. Identify Causes**: Why might failure occur?
- Tool wear
- Setup error
- Operator error
- Material variation

**5. Rate Severity, Occurrence, Detection** (1-10 scale):

**Severity (S)**: How serious is the effect?
- 1: No effect
- 5-6: Moderate (rework, customer dissatisfaction)
- 9-10: Critical (safety hazard, regulatory violation)

**Occurrence (O)**: How likely is the cause?
- 1: Remote (<1 in 1,000,000)
- 5-6: Moderate (1 in 1,000)
- 9-10: Very high (>1 in 10)

**Detection (D)**: How likely to detect before reaching customer?
- 1: Almost certain to detect
- 5-6: Moderate detection chance
- 9-10: Cannot detect

**6. Calculate Risk Priority Number (RPN)**:
```
RPN = Severity × Occurrence × Detection
```

High RPN = High priority for corrective action (typically RPN >100 or >125)

**7. Identify Actions**: Corrective actions to reduce S, O, or D

**8. Re-Calculate RPN**: After actions implemented, verify RPN reduced

**FMEA Example**: CNC Turning Operation

| Process Step | Failure Mode | Effect | Severity | Cause | Occurrence | Current Controls | Detection | RPN | Recommended Action | Responsibility |
|--------------|--------------|--------|----------|-------|------------|------------------|-----------|-----|-------------------|----------------|
| Turn OD | Diameter oversize | Scrap | 6 | Tool wear | 5 | Visual tool checks | 3 | 90 | Implement tool life tracking | Production Mgr |
| Turn OD | Diameter undersize | Scrap | 6 | Setup error (work offset) | 3 | First-off inspection | 2 | 36 | (Acceptable, no action) | - |
| Drill hole | Hole location wrong | Scrap, customer complaint | 8 | Program error | 2 | Program verification, FAI | 4 | 64 | Implement program approval checklist | Engineering |
| Drill hole | Hole diameter oversize | Scrap | 6 | Worn drill | 4 | Periodic checks | 4 | 96 | Establish drill life limits | Production Mgr |

**Actions Based on RPN**:
- RPN >100: Action required
- RPN 50-100: Action recommended
- RPN <50: Acceptable risk (monitor)

**After Actions Implemented** (Re-calculate):
- Turn OD, diameter oversize: Occurrence reduced to 2 (tool life tracking prevents excessive wear) → RPN = 6×2×3 = 36 ✓
- Drill hole, diameter oversize: Occurrence reduced to 2, Detection reduced to 2 (tighter checks) → RPN = 6×2×2 = 24 ✓

**FMEA Benefits**:
- Proactive (identifies risks before failures occur)
- Prioritizes actions (focus on highest RPN)
- Structured and comprehensive
- Documents risk analysis

**FMEA Standards**:
- AIAG FMEA Manual (automotive)
- AIAG & VDA FMEA Handbook (2019) - latest standard

## 22.9.2 8D Problem Solving Process

**8D (Eight Disciplines)**: Structured problem-solving methodology developed by Ford, widely used in automotive and manufacturing

**8D Steps**:

### D0: Prepare for 8D

- **Purpose**: Determine if 8D appropriate for problem
- **Activities**:
  - Assess problem severity and scope
  - Collect initial data
  - Decide if 8D required (or simpler method sufficient)

### D1: Establish the Team

- **Purpose**: Form cross-functional team with knowledge and authority
- **Activities**:
  - Identify team members (quality, engineering, production, customer rep if applicable)
  - Assign team leader
  - Define roles and responsibilities
- **Team Skills Needed**: Process knowledge, technical expertise, problem-solving skills, authority to implement actions

### D2: Describe the Problem

- **Purpose**: Clearly define the problem using data
- **Activities**:
  - Use **5W2H** method:
    - **What** is the problem?
    - **When** did it occur? (first occurrence, frequency)
    - **Where** discovered? (operation, location, customer)
    - **Who** discovered? affected?
    - **Why** is it a problem? (impact)
    - **How** many affected? (quantity, scope)
    - **How** detected?
  - Quantify problem (defect rate, scrap cost, customer complaints)
- **Example**: "25 parts from Lot 2024-0515 have hole diameter .505" (spec .500±.002"), discovered at final inspection on 15-May-2024. Parts scrapped, cost $1,250. Customer delivery delayed 1 week."

### D3: Implement Interim Containment Actions (ICA)

- **Purpose**: Protect customer from defective product while root cause investigated
- **Activities**:
  - Sort/inspect remaining inventory (separate good from bad)
  - Increase inspection frequency (100% inspection until problem resolved)
  - Notify customer (if product shipped)
  - Recall or screen product at customer (if necessary)
- **ICA Not Permanent**: Temporary until corrective action implemented

### D4: Identify Root Cause

- **Purpose**: Determine why problem occurred
- **Activities**:
  - Use root cause analysis tools (5 Whys, Fishbone, Fault Tree)
  - Brainstorm potential causes
  - Test hypotheses with data or experiments
  - Verify root cause (recreate problem by introducing root cause; eliminate problem by removing root cause)
- **Example**: Root cause = No tool life tracking; verified by testing (tool life exceeded → oversize parts; tool changed on time → parts in spec)

### D5: Choose and Verify Permanent Corrective Actions (PCA)

- **Purpose**: Select actions that eliminate root cause and verify effectiveness
- **Activities**:
  - Brainstorm potential corrective actions
  - Evaluate options (cost, feasibility, effectiveness)
  - Select best action(s)
  - Test on small scale (pilot) to verify effectiveness
- **Example PCA**: Implement tool life tracking system in ERP; establish tool replacement interval (200 parts); train operators

### D6: Implement and Validate Permanent Corrective Actions

- **Purpose**: Implement PCA broadly and verify long-term effectiveness
- **Activities**:
  - Roll out PCA to all affected areas
  - Update procedures, work instructions, forms
  - Train personnel
  - Monitor performance (verify problem does not recur)
  - Remove Interim Containment Actions (return to normal inspection)
- **Validation Period**: 30-90 days typical (monitor for recurrence)

### D7: Prevent Recurrence (Preventive Actions)

- **Purpose**: Apply lessons learned to prevent similar problems elsewhere
- **Activities**:
  - Identify similar processes or products at risk
  - Apply corrective action to those areas
  - Update standards, design guidelines, training materials
- **Example**: Tool life tracking implemented for problematic operation; expand to all operations using cutting tools

### D8: Recognize the Team and Close

- **Purpose**: Acknowledge team's efforts and formally close 8D
- **Activities**:
  - Document 8D process and results
  - Share lessons learned (bulletin, training, management review)
  - Recognize team contributions (thank team, celebrate success)
  - Archive 8D report
- **8D Report**: Comprehensive documentation of all steps (D0-D7)

**8D Report Template**: Single document capturing all disciplines, used for tracking and communication

**8D Benefits**:
- Structured and thorough
- Team-based (leverages diverse expertise)
- Customer-focused (interim containment protects customer)
- Prevents recurrence (D7 applies lessons broadly)
- Widely recognized (especially in automotive)

---

## 22.9.3 Corrective Action Planning and Implementation

### Corrective Action Report (CAR)

**CAR**: Document that initiates and tracks corrective action process

**CAR vs. NCR**:
- **NCR** (Nonconformance Report): Documents nonconforming product and disposition
- **CAR** (Corrective Action Report): Documents root cause analysis and corrective action to prevent recurrence
- Often linked: NCR identifies problem, CAR investigates and corrects

**CAR Triggers**:
- Nonconformances (internal, customer)
- Audit findings
- Customer complaints
- Process performance issues (scrap, rework, low Cpk)
- Near-misses (problems caught before causing defects)
- Management review action items

**CAR Contents** (similar to 8D):
1. **Problem Description**: What happened? (clear, specific, data-driven)
2. **Containment**: Immediate actions taken
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Why did it happen? (method used, findings)
4. **Corrective Action Plan**: What will be done to prevent recurrence?
   - Specific actions
   - Responsible person
   - Target completion date
5. **Implementation**: Actions completed (evidence)
6. **Effectiveness Verification**: Did corrective action work? (monitoring results)
7. **Closure**: Verified effective, closed (signature, date)

**CAR Approval**:
- Quality Manager reviews and approves root cause analysis
- Action owners approve action plans
- Quality Manager approves closure (after verification)

### Corrective Action Implementation

**Typical Corrective Actions**:
- **Process Changes**: Modify process parameters, add controls, automate
- **Procedure Updates**: Revise work instructions, add steps, clarify requirements
- **Training**: Educate personnel on proper methods, new procedures
- **Equipment**: Repair, upgrade, replace equipment or tooling
- **Inspection**: Add inspection points, increase frequency, improve gages
- **Design Changes**: Modify product design to eliminate issue (if design-related)
- **Supplier Actions**: Change suppliers, increase incoming inspection, implement supplier corrective action

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Plan**: Define specific actions, responsibilities, timelines, resources
2. **Communicate**: Notify affected personnel, explain changes
3. **Execute**: Perform actions (procedure updates, training, equipment changes)
4. **Document**: Record evidence of implementation (training records, procedure revisions, photos)
5. **Verify**: Check that actions implemented correctly

**Example Corrective Action Implementation**:

**Problem**: Holes drilled oversize due to worn drills

**Root Cause**: No drill life tracking

**Corrective Action Plan**:
1. Establish drill life limits (Action: Engineering conducts tool life study; Due: 30-May)
2. Implement tracking in ERP (Action: IT configures ERP module; Due: 15-Jun)
3. Create work instruction for drill replacement (Action: Quality writes WI-120; Due: 10-Jun)
4. Train operators (Action: Supervisor conducts training; Due: 20-Jun)
5. Monitor drill life compliance (Action: Supervisor spot-checks; Ongoing)

**Implementation Evidence**:
- Tool life study report (drills last 500 holes ±10%)
- ERP system configured (screenshot showing drill counter)
- WI-120 Rev A approved and distributed
- Training records (10 operators trained on 20-Jun)
- Spot-check log (shows drill changes at proper intervals)

---

## 22.9.4 Preventive Action and Risk Mitigation

**Preventive Action**: Action taken to eliminate causes of potential nonconformances (before they occur)

**ISO 9001:2015 Approach**:
- No separate "Preventive Action" clause (was in ISO 9001:2008)
- Preventive action integrated through **Risk-Based Thinking** (Clause 6.1)
- Identify risks proactively, implement actions to mitigate

### Sources of Preventive Action

**Risk Assessments**:
- Identify potential problems during process design or product introduction
- FMEA highlights risks requiring preventive action

**Trend Analysis**:
- Monitor metrics (scrap rate, customer complaints, Cpk)
- Increasing trends signal need for preventive action

**Lessons Learned**:
- Apply corrective actions from one area to similar areas (D7 in 8D)
- Industry trends or competitor issues

**Near-Misses**:
- Problems caught before causing defects (close call)
- Investigate and prevent actual occurrence

**Audit Observations**:
- Non-critical findings (observations) may become nonconformances if not addressed

**Example Preventive Actions**:
- Tool life tracking implemented after one operation had issues → Apply to all operations (prevent similar issues elsewhere)
- Temperature swings observed affecting precision → Install climate control (prevent dimensional issues)
- Supplier quality deteriorating (trend in reject rate) → Audit supplier, implement corrective action (prevent shipment of defective material)

---

## 22.9.5 Effectiveness Verification

**Effectiveness Verification**: Confirm that corrective action eliminated problem and prevented recurrence

**Why Verification Critical**:
- Ineffective corrective actions waste resources
- Problem recurs, damaging customer confidence
- Verify = learning (if not effective, revise action)

### Verification Methods

**1. Monitor Metrics**:
- Track performance data after corrective action implemented
- Compare before vs. after
- Example: Scrap rate 5% before, 1% after (30-day monitoring) → Effective

**2. Audit/Inspection**:
- Verify corrective action implemented correctly (procedure followed, equipment functioning)
- Example: Audit shows operators following new drill replacement procedure → Effective implementation

**3. No Recurrence**:
- Problem does not recur over monitoring period (30-90 days typical)
- Example: No oversized holes detected in 60 days → Effective

**4. Customer Feedback**:
- Customer complaints stop or reduce
- Example: Customer complaint about late deliveries; after action, OTD improves to 98%, no complaints for 3 months → Effective

**5. Statistical Verification**:
- Cpk improves (capability increased)
- Control charts show process stable and in control
- Example: Cpk before 0.9 (incapable), Cpk after 1.5 (capable) → Effective

### Verification Period

**Typical Timeframes**:
- **Short-term** (30 days): Immediate verification (procedure followed, problem stopped)
- **Long-term** (90 days): Sustained effectiveness (no recurrence over time)

**When to Verify**:
- Not immediately (allow time for action to take effect)
- Not too late (problem may recur if action ineffective)
- Risk-based (higher risk → longer monitoring)

### If Corrective Action Ineffective

**Signs of Ineffective Action**:
- Problem recurs
- Metrics do not improve
- Root cause was incorrect (addressed symptom, not root cause)

**Actions if Ineffective**:
1. **Re-open CAR**: Do not close; action ineffective
2. **Re-analyze Root Cause**: Was root cause identified correctly?
3. **Revise Corrective Action**: Modify action or implement additional actions
4. **Re-verify**: Monitor again after revised action implemented

**Example**:
- **Problem**: Holes drilled oversize
- **Corrective Action**: Train operators on proper drill use
- **Verification (30 days)**: Problem recurs (3 more lots with oversized holes)
- **Conclusion**: Ineffective (training alone insufficient)
- **Revised Action**: Implement tool life tracking (more robust solution)
- **Re-verification (60 days)**: No recurrence → Effective

## 22.9.6 CAPA Documentation and Tracking

### CAPA Records

**Required Records** (ISO 9001, FDA, aerospace, medical):
- Problem description
- Root cause analysis
- Corrective/preventive actions
- Implementation evidence
- Effectiveness verification
- Approval and closure

**Retention**: Per regulatory or customer requirements (7-10 years typical)

### CAPA Tracking System

## Summary

Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) drives continuous improvement by systematically investigating problems, identifying root causes, implementing solutions, and verifying effectiveness. Root cause analysis tools (5 Whys, Fishbone, Fault Tree, FMEA) identify why problems occur. The 8D problem-solving process provides structured approach emphasizing team collaboration and customer protection. Effectiveness verification ensures corrective actions work. Preventive actions eliminate potential problems before they occur. CAPA documentation and tracking ensure accountability and enable trend analysis.

A strong CAPA system transforms problems into opportunities for improvement, building a learning organization that continually enhances quality and performance.
