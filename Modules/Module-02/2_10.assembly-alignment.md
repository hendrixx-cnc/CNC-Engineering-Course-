# Module 2 – Vertical Axis & Z-Stage


## Overview

Precision assembly and alignment of vertical axis components determines achievable accuracy and long-term reliability. This section provides systematic procedures for column installation, linear rail tramming, ball screw alignment, and final system verification.

## Pre-Assembly Preparation

### Base/Frame Verification

**Critical mounting surface requirements:**
- Flatness: 20 µm over mounting area
- Perpendicularity to X-Y plane: 50 µm/m
- Surface finish: 3.2 µm Ra or better
- Tapped holes: Clean threads, proper depth

**Inspection procedure:**
1. Place precision granite square or angle plate on base
2. Indicate mounting surface flatness (sweep in grid pattern)
3. Check perpendicularity with precision square and indicator
4. Verify hole locations against drawing (±0.1mm tolerance)
5. Clean and degrease mounting surface

**If surface not within specification:**
- Scrape or hand-grind high spots
- Re-machine if deviation >100 µm
- Use shims only as last resort (reduces rigidity)

### Component Inspection

**Inspect all components before assembly:**

**Column:**
- Rail mounting surfaces flat (10 µm target)
- Ball screw mounting faces parallel and square
- No burrs, damage, or debris
- Protective coatings removed from precision surfaces

**Linear rails:**
- Check rail straightness with comparator (±5 µm)
- Inspect for damage during shipping
- Verify carriage preload by hand feel (smooth, consistent resistance)
- Rails match as set (often marked L/R or 1/2)

**Ball screw:**
- Bearing seats clean and undamaged
- Thread runout <10 µm TIR (check with indicator)
- Couplings inspected, set screws present

### Tools Required

**Precision instruments:**
- Dial indicator (0.001mm / 0.5 µm resolution)
- Magnetic base and extensions
- Precision parallel (ground to ±2 µm)
- Granite angle plate (reference surface)
- Feeler gauges (metric, 0.02-1.0mm)

**Installation tools:**
- Torque wrench (accurate to ±4%)
- Allen key set (quality, no rounding)
- Soft-face mallet (assembly)
- Degreaser and lint-free wipes
- Grease (specified for bearings and guides)

## Column Installation

### Step 1: Position and Level

**Mounting the column to base:**

1. **Apply thin coat of way oil** to base mounting surface (prevents galling, aids alignment)
2. **Position column** onto base mounting surface
   - Use lifting equipment for large columns (>20 kg)
   - Avoid dropping or impact
3. **Insert locating dowel pins** (if designed with dowels)
   - Dowels provide repeatable positioning
   - Tight slip fit (H7/m6 tolerance typical)
4. **Check perpendicularity** to base using precision square and indicator
   - Sweep column face at top and bottom
   - Target: <25 µm deviation over column height
5. **Shim if necessary** to achieve perpendicularity
   - Use precision ground shims (not feeler gauges)
   - Minimum number of shim locations
   - Shim entire contact area (not just corners)

### Step 2: Secure Column

**Fastener installation sequence:**

1. **Insert all mounting bolts** finger-tight
2. **Tighten bolts progressively** in cross-pattern
   - Start center, work outward
   - Multiple passes, increasing torque each pass
3. **Final torque** per specification
   - M8: 20-25 N·m typical
   - M10: 40-50 N·m typical
   - M12: 70-85 N·m typical
4. **Re-check perpendicularity** after torquing
   - Torque can distort alignment
   - If deviation >25 µm, loosen and re-align

**Important:** Use threadlocker (medium-strength, e.g., Loctite 243) on all structural fasteners.

### Step 3: Final Verification

**Column rigidity check:**
1. Attempt to deflect column by hand at top (reasonable force)
2. No detectable movement (indicates proper mounting)
3. If movement detected, check fastener torque and base contact

**Perpendicularity documentation:**
- Record final indicator readings
- Document shim locations and thickness
- Photograph assembly for future reference

## Linear Rail Installation

### Step 1: Rail Mounting Surface Preparation

**Critical step for long-term accuracy:**

1. **Clean mounting surfaces** on column
   - Remove all oil, debris, protective coatings
   - Solvent wipe followed by dry wipe
2. **Inspect flatness** of each rail mounting surface
   - Sweep with indicator along full length
   - Target: <10 µm deviation
   - If >20 µm, surface requires machining or scraping
3. **Apply thin film of grease** to mounting surface
   - Prevents corrosion, aids initial alignment
   - Wipe excess (should be barely visible film)

### Step 2: First Rail Installation

**Establishing reference rail:**

1. **Position first rail** on mounting surface
   - Align rail length to column travel direction
   - Center rail on mounting pad
2. **Insert mounting bolts** finger-tight
3. **Tram rail** to column reference surface
   - Place precision parallel against rail side face
   - Sweep parallel with indicator along full rail length
   - Adjust rail position to minimize deviation
   - Target: <20 µm TIR over full length
4. **Tighten mounting bolts progressively**
   - Start at center, work toward ends
   - Torque per rail manufacturer specification (typically 10-15 N·m for HGR15/20)
5. **Re-check tramming** after torquing
   - Torque can shift rail
   - If deviation >20 µm, loosen and repeat

### Step 3: Second Rail Installation (Parallelism)

**Most critical alignment step:**

1. **Install carriages** on first rail
2. **Position precision parallel** between first and second rail mounting surfaces
   - Parallel spans between the two rails
   - Parallel length matches rail spacing
3. **Position second rail** using parallel as reference
4. **Indicate parallelism** at multiple positions along rail length
   - Top, middle, bottom of travel
   - Adjust second rail until parallel to first rail
   - Target: <20 µm deviation over full length
5. **Tighten mounting bolts progressively**
6. **Final verification:**
   - Install carriage on second rail
   - Slide both carriages manually along full travel
   - Should move smoothly with consistent resistance
   - Any binding indicates misalignment

**If binding detected:**
- Loosen second rail
- Use indicator to find tight spot
- Adjust rail at that location
- Re-torque and test

### Step 4: Carriage Installation

**Installing carriages on rails:**

1. **Apply lubricant** to rails (per manufacturer specification)
2. **Slide carriages** onto rails from end
   - Do not disassemble carriages (loses preload setting)
   - Keep carriages oriented correctly (marked "up" or with arrow)
3. **Distribute carriages** along rail
   - Space evenly for initial testing
4. **Install end stops** (prevent carriage from running off rail)
   - Mechanical stops at both ends of travel
   - 10-20mm from maximum travel limits

## Ball Screw Installation

### Step 1: Bearing Mounting

**Fixed-end bearing (bottom typical):**

1. **Clean bearing seat** in column
   - No burrs, debris, or damage
2. **Install angular contact bearings** per manufacturer instructions
   - Correct orientation (load side facing thrust direction)
   - Preload shims if specified
3. **Install bearing housing**
   - Torque fasteners per specification
   - Lock nuts or threadlocker as required
4. **Check bearing preload** by rotating screw by hand
   - Should rotate smoothly with slight resistance
   - Too tight: excessive friction, premature wear
   - Too loose: backlash, reduced stiffness

**Supported-end bearing (top typical):**

1. **Install radial bearing** (allows thermal expansion)
   - Bearing free to slide axially
   - Maintains lateral location only
2. **Secure bearing housing**

**Center support bearing (if used):**
- Install after screw positioned
- Adjust for proper support without binding screw

### Step 2: Ball Screw Alignment

**Critical for smooth motion and long life:**

1. **Position ball screw** in fixed-end bearing
2. **Check screw runout** at supported end
   - Place indicator on screw surface near bearing
   - Rotate screw by hand, observe runout
   - Target: <10 µm TIR
3. **Adjust screw position** to minimize runout
   - Shim bearing housing if necessary
   - Eccentric bearing mount (if provided) simplifies adjustment
4. **Secure supported-end bearing**
5. **Install ball nut** onto screw
   - Lubricate with specified grease
   - Do not disassemble nut (loses ball preload)

### Step 3: Coupling Installation

**Motor-to-screw coupling:**

1. **Align motor shaft** to ball screw
   - Motor mounted to column or carriage
   - Shafts collinear (no angular or parallel offset)
2. **Measure alignment** with dial indicator
   - Rotate both shafts, observe TIR on each
   - Angular misalignment: <0.05mm TIR
   - Parallel offset: <0.1mm
3. **Install flexible coupling**
   - Helical beam coupling recommended (accommodates slight misalignment)
   - Set screws on flats (not threads)
   - Torque set screws per coupling specification
4. **Verify alignment** after coupling installed
   - Rotate motor shaft by hand
   - Smooth rotation, no binding or vibration

**Important:** Rigid couplings require near-perfect alignment (<0.02mm). Use flexible couplings for easier assembly and better tolerance of thermal expansion.

## Carriage Assembly and Mounting

### Ball Nut to Carriage

**Connecting ball nut to moving carriage:**

1. **Position carriage** at mid-travel
2. **Attach ball nut** to carriage plate
   - Ball nut flange typically bolted to carriage bottom
   - Use washers to distribute load
   - Torque bolts evenly (cross-pattern)
3. **Check that carriage moves freely** when screw rotated
   - If binding: Check rail parallelism and screw alignment
   - Screw must be parallel to rails (no skew)

### Carriage Perpendicularity

**Ensure carriage perpendicular to column:**

1. **Mount precision angle plate** to carriage
2. **Indicate against column reference surface**
   - Sweep indicator across carriage face
   - Adjust carriage mounting (if slotted holes provided)
   - Target: <25 µm deviation across carriage width
3. **Tighten carriage mounting bolts**

## Counterbalance Installation

### Gas Spring Mounting

**Typical configuration for small-medium machines:**

1. **Identify mounting points**
   - Fixed end: Column or frame
   - Moving end: Carriage
2. **Install gas spring** per manufacturer orientation
   - Piston rod down (oil stays at cylinder head)
   - Mounting clevis with pivot pins
3. **Verify force balance**
   - With motor de-energized and brake released (use caution—support carriage)
   - Carriage should hold position at mid-travel
   - Slight upward bias acceptable (±5%)
4. **Adjust if necessary**
   - Swap gas spring for different force rating
   - Add/remove mass from carriage if adjustable

### Pneumatic Counterbalance

**For larger machines:**

1. **Connect pneumatic cylinder** to air supply
2. **Install pressure regulator** in line
3. **Set pressure** to balance carriage weight
   - Starting point: P = F / A (force divided by piston area)
   - Fine-tune by testing motion balance
4. **Lock regulator setting** after adjustment

## System-Level Alignment Checks

### Runout Verification

**Spindle-to-table alignment:**

1. **Mount dial indicator** in spindle (if spindle installed)
2. **Sweep indicator** against flat surface on table
3. **Move Z-axis** over full travel while observing indicator
4. **Record runout:** Should be <50 µm for general milling, <25 µm for precision
5. **If excessive runout:**
   - Check column perpendicularity to base
   - Verify rail parallelism
   - Inspect ball screw alignment

### Travel Limits

**Verify full Z-axis travel:**

1. **Jog carriage** to bottom limit (manually or with motor)
2. **Note position** (use DRO or mark reference)
3. **Jog to top limit**
4. **Measure total travel** and compare to specification
5. **Set software limits** in control system
   - Soft limits 5-10mm inside mechanical limits
   - Prevents crashes

### Backlash Measurement

**Check system backlash:**

1. **Mount dial indicator** against carriage (reading Z-direction)
2. **Jog Z-axis upward** 10mm, zero indicator
3. **Command Z-axis downward** 10mm (observe when indicator begins moving)
4. **Backlash = commanded distance before indicator moves**
5. **Acceptable values:**
   - General purpose: <50 µm
   - Precision: <20 µm
   - Ultra-precision: <5 µm
6. **If excessive backlash:**
   - Check ball nut preload (adjustable on some screws)
   - Inspect coupling for play
   - Verify rail carriage preload

## Cable Management Installation

### Cable Carrier Mounting

**Per Section 2.9 guidelines:**

1. **Mount fixed end** of carrier
   - Top of column or frame (for top-mount configuration)
   - Rigid mounting bracket
   - Strain relief for cables exiting carrier
2. **Mount moving end** to carriage
   - Secure bracket to carriage plate
   - Flexible conduit for last 150mm to components
3. **Route cables** through carrier
   - Power on one side, signal on other (EMI separation)
   - Secure cables every 200-300mm inside carrier
   - Maintain bend radius (≥10× largest cable diameter)
4. **Test full travel**
   - Move carriage through full range
   - Verify carrier moves smoothly, no snagging
   - Check cable strain relief at both ends

## Common Assembly Issues

### Rail Binding

**Symptom:** Carriage difficult to move, uneven resistance

**Causes:**
- Rails not parallel (most common)
- Mounting surface not flat
- Over-torqued mounting bolts (distorts rail)
- Debris under rail

**Solution:**
1. Loosen all rail mounting bolts
2. Check mounting surface flatness
3. Re-tram rails with precision parallel
4. Torque bolts progressively, re-check after each pass
5. Test carriage motion frequently during assembly

### Ball Screw Binding

**Symptom:** Rough rotation, tight spots, motor stalling

**Causes:**
- Screw not aligned to rails (skewed)
- Bearing over-preloaded
- Coupling misalignment
- Ball nut to carriage mounting stressed

**Solution:**
1. Check screw-to-rail parallelism (should be within 0.1mm over travel)
2. Verify bearing preload (should rotate smoothly by hand)
3. Re-check coupling alignment
4. Loosen ball nut mounting, verify free rotation, re-torque gently

### Excessive Runout

**Symptom:** Spindle runout >50 µm over Z travel

**Causes:**
- Column not perpendicular to base
- Rails not parallel
- Column deflection under carriage weight

**Solution:**
1. Re-check column perpendicularity, shim if needed
2. Verify rail tramming
3. If deflection issue, stiffen column (Section 2.3) or reduce moving mass

## Key Takeaways

1. **Base flatness and perpendicularity** are foundation for all subsequent alignment
2. **Rail tramming** requires precision parallel and indicator—target <20 µm parallelism
3. **Rail parallelism** critical: Binding indicates misalignment
4. **Ball screw runout** should be <10 µm TIR at bearing seats
5. **Coupling alignment** prevents premature bearing wear (use flexible coupling)
6. **Counterbalance verification** before motor tuning (release brake, observe balance)
7. **System-level checks** validate component assembly (runout over travel, backlash)
8. **Documentation** enables future maintenance and troubleshooting
9. **Progressive torquing** prevents distortion (cross-pattern, multiple passes)
10. **Test frequently** during assembly: Small adjustments easier than complete disassembly
