# Section 26.17 – Work-Life Balance as a Business Owner

## Overview

"Be your own boss" sounds like freedom—set your own hours, answer to no one, reap the rewards of your work. The reality? Business owners often work longer hours, carry more stress, sacrifice more personal time, and struggle to "turn off" work than they ever did as employees.

Work-life balance as a CNC business owner is one of the most challenging aspects of ownership—yet also one of the most important for long-term success, health, relationships, and happiness. Burnout destroys businesses, marriages, and health. This section addresses the reality of ownership hours, strategies for delegation and letting go, taking time off, family involvement and boundaries, avoiding burnout, and planning your eventual exit.

**Critical Reality:** Owning a business doesn't mean freedom initially. For the first 3-5 years, expect to work more hours and have less free time than you did as an employee. Freedom comes later, but only if you build systems and delegate effectively.

## 17.1 The Reality of Ownership Hours

### The Myth vs. Reality

**The Myth:**
- "I'll work when I want"
- "I'll take Fridays off"
- "I'll be on the golf course by 2 PM"
- "Employees will run the shop while I vacation"

**The Reality (First 5 Years):**

**Year 1:**
- 60-80 hours per week typical
- Weekends often worked (catching up, quoting, programming)
- Vacations rare or nonexistent
- Constant stress about cash flow, landing jobs, keeping machines running

**Years 2-3:**
- 50-70 hours per week
- Some weekends off, but still frequent weekend work
- Short vacations possible (3-4 days, not weeks)
- Stress remains high but more manageable

**Years 4-5:**
- 45-60 hours per week (if you've hired and delegated)
- More predictable schedule
- 1-2 week vacations possible
- Business more stable, less constant crisis

**Years 5-10+:**
- 40-50 hours per week possible (if systems and employees in place)
- Regular time off achievable
- Business runs without constant owner presence
- True "owner" role vs. "operator" role

### Why Owners Work So Much

**1. You Wear All the Hats:**

As owner, especially initially, you are:
- Machinist (running machines)
- Programmer (CAM work)
- Quality inspector
- Salesperson (quoting, customer calls)
- Bookkeeper (invoicing, paying bills)
- Janitor (cleaning, maintenance)
- IT department (computer issues)
- HR (hiring, managing employees)

**Each role takes time.** Employees specialize; owners generalize.

**2. The Buck Stops With You:**

- Missed deadline? Your problem.
- Machine breaks down? You fix it or arrange repair.
- Customer complaint? You handle it.
- Cash flow tight? You solve it.

**No one else** will care about your business as much as you do.

**3. Financial Pressure:**

Early years: Every hour NOT working feels like lost revenue. Bills pile up. Temptation to say "yes" to every job, work every weekend, push through exhaustion.

**4. Perfectionism and Control:**

Many owners struggle to delegate because:
- "No one will do it as well as me"
- "I can do it faster myself"
- "I don't trust employees with this"

**Result:** Owner becomes bottleneck, works excessive hours, prevents business growth.

### Hour Expectations by Phase

**Startup Phase (Months 1-12):**
- **70-80 hours/week** common
- 7 days/week often
- Nights spent programming, quoting, bookkeeping

**Example Weekly Schedule (Year 1):**
```
Monday-Friday: 7 AM - 7 PM (12 hours × 5 = 60 hours)
Saturday: 8 AM - 2 PM (6 hours)
Sunday: Programming/quoting at home (4 hours)
TOTAL: 70 hours
```

**Growth Phase (Years 2-4):**
- **50-65 hours/week**
- 6 days/week (some Sundays off)
- Occasional evening work

**Stabilization Phase (Years 5+):**
- **45-55 hours/week** (if delegated well)
- 5-6 days/week
- Limited evening work

### The Non-Quantifiable Work

Beyond hours worked physically in the shop:

**Mental Load:**
- Waking at 3 AM worrying about cash flow
- Thinking about business during dinner, family time, "vacations"
- Stress over bids, deadlines, employee issues
- Constant low-level anxiety

**Owners never truly "clock out."** Your business lives in your mind 24/7, especially early years.

### Is It Worth It?

**For Some: Yes**
- Love of machining and independence outweighs hours
- Building equity and long-term wealth
- Pride of ownership
- Eventually (5-10+ years) achieve better balance than employment

**For Others: No**
- Quality of life suffers
- Relationships strained
- Health declines
- Would have been happier (and earned similar money) as employee

**Critical Self-Assessment:** Be honest about your tolerance for long hours, stress, and delayed gratification. Not everyone is built for ownership.

## 17.2 Delegation and Letting Go

### The Owner's Dilemma

To achieve work-life balance, you MUST delegate. But delegation requires:
- Hiring employees (cost, risk, management time)
- Training (investment, patience)
- Trusting others (difficult for perfectionists)
- Accepting "good enough" instead of "perfect"

**Common Trap:**

Owner hires employee, but:
- Micromanages every task
- Redoes work because "not good enough"
- Doesn't train properly
- Refuses to delegate important tasks

**Result:** Owner still works 70 hours/week, now with added employee costs and management headaches. Worst of both worlds.

### What to Delegate (And When)

**Priority 1: Delegate Low-Skill, Time-Consuming Tasks First**

These free up owner time without requiring highly skilled (expensive) employees:

| Task | When to Delegate | Skill Required | Cost |
|------|------------------|----------------|------|
| **Shop Cleaning** | Year 1 (part-time) | Low | $15-20/hr, 5-10 hrs/week |
| **Material Handling** | Year 1-2 (part-time) | Low | $15-20/hr |
| **Deburring, Basic Finishing** | Year 1-2 | Low-Moderate | $18-25/hr |
| **Simple Machining Ops** | Year 2-3 | Moderate | $20-30/hr |
| **Bookkeeping** | Year 2-3 (outsource or part-time) | Moderate | $25-40/hr or $500-1,500/month outsourced |

**Priority 2: Delegate Skilled Tasks (Requires Training Investment)**

| Task | When to Delegate | Skill Required | Cost |
|------|------------------|----------------|------|
| **CNC Operation** | Year 2-4 | High | $25-40/hr (experienced machinist) |
| **Programming (Simple Jobs)** | Year 3-5 | High | $30-45/hr |
| **Quality Inspection** | Year 3-5 | Moderate-High | $25-35/hr |
| **Customer Quoting** | Year 4-6 | High (judgment, experience) | $30-50/hr or profit-sharing |

**Priority 3: Retain Strategic Tasks (Hardest to Delegate)**

These should remain with owner longest:
- **Customer relationship management** (key accounts)
- **Strategic planning and decision-making**
- **Financial management** (though bookkeeper can handle data entry)
- **High-value or critical jobs** (until fully confident in team)

### How to Delegate Effectively

**1. Document Processes:**

Before delegating, document the task:
- Step-by-step procedures
- Quality standards
- Common mistakes to avoid
- When to ask for help

**Written SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures)** allow employees to reference instructions without constant questions.

**2. Train Thoroughly:**

- Demonstrate task
- Have employee perform while you watch
- Provide feedback
- Allow practice with supervision
- Gradually reduce oversight

**Don't:** Throw employee into task without training, then criticize mistakes.

**3. Accept "Good Enough":**

**80% of your quality done by an employee is better than 100% done by you if it frees you to focus on higher-value tasks.**

Example:
- You: Spend 3 hours deburring parts (highly skilled owner time = opportunity cost)
- Employee: Spends 4 hours deburring same parts to 90% of your quality

**Better:** You spend 3 hours quoting jobs (revenue-generating) while employee deburrs.

**4. Provide Authority and Trust:**

If you delegate a task but require approval for every decision, you haven't truly delegated. Empower employees to make decisions within defined boundaries.

**Example:**
- Bad: "Check with me before every setup decision"
- Good: "For standard jobs under $500, use your judgment. For complex or high-value jobs, discuss setup with me first."

**5. Monitor, Don't Micromanage:**

Check results periodically (daily or weekly depending on task) without hovering.

- Inspect finished parts, not every setup decision
- Review bookkeeping monthly, not every transaction
- Spot-check programming, not every toolpath

### Overcoming the Delegation Barrier

**Common Fears:**

**"No one will do it as well as me."**
- True initially. But with training and practice, employees often reach 90-95% of your ability—sufficient for most jobs.

**"It's faster if I just do it myself."**
- True short-term. But long-term, training an employee yields 100x return on time invested.

**"I can't afford to hire."**
- Calculate opportunity cost: If you're doing $20/hr work (deburring) instead of $100/hr work (quoting/selling), you're losing $80/hr. Hiring is profitable.

**"I don't trust them."**
- Start small: Delegate low-risk tasks first. Build trust gradually.

**"What if they leave and take my knowledge?"**
- Risk exists. But alternative (doing everything yourself forever) guarantees burnout and limits growth.

### The Freedom Test

**Goal:** Business can operate for 1 week without you (eventually 2-4 weeks).

**Milestones:**

**Level 1: 1 Day Off** (Year 1-2)
- Employees can run production while you're out
- Emergency phone calls only

**Level 2: 1 Week Off** (Year 3-5)
- Employees handle production, customer communication, routine issues
- You check email/phone once daily

**Level 3: 2+ Weeks Off** (Year 5-10)
- Manager or senior employee makes decisions
- You check in 1-2 times per week, no daily involvement

**Most owners never reach Level 3.** Reaching Level 2 is a huge accomplishment and provides reasonable work-life balance.

## 17.3 Taking Time Off

### Why Owners Don't Take Time Off

**Fear:**
- "What if something goes wrong?"
- "What if we lose a customer?"
- "What if employees slack off?"

**Guilt:**
- "Employees are working, I should be too"
- "I can't afford to lose production time"

**Habit:**
- After years of 70-hour weeks, taking time off feels wrong
- Addiction to work (workaholism)

**Reality Check:**

**You NEED time off.** Burnout leads to:
- Poor decision-making
- Health problems (heart disease, depression, high blood pressure)
- Damaged relationships (divorce, estrangement from kids)
- Resentment of business (hating what you built)
- Eventual shutdown or sale due to burnout

**Taking time off is not selfish—it's essential for business sustainability.**

### Strategies for Taking Time Off

**1. Start Small:**

If you've never taken time off, don't start with 2-week vacation.

**Progressive Schedule:**
- **Month 1:** Take Sunday completely off (no shop, no email)
- **Month 2:** Add Saturday afternoon off
- **Month 3:** Take a 3-day weekend
- **Year 2:** Take a full week vacation
- **Year 3+:** Take 1-2 weeks annually

**2. Plan Ahead:**

Don't take spontaneous time off initially—schedule it:
- Notify customers 4-6 weeks in advance
- Finish critical jobs before leaving
- Prep employees with task lists and priorities
- Arrange coverage for emergencies (trusted employee or subcontractor)

**3. Set Communication Boundaries:**

**Bad:** "Call me anytime if there's a problem"
- You'll get called constantly
- Employees won't develop problem-solving skills
- Vacation ruined

**Good:** "Call me only for true emergencies: machine fire, major injury, customer threatening lawsuit. For everything else, handle it or wait until I return."

Define "emergency" clearly. 99% of issues can wait a few days.

**4. Test Systems Before Vacation:**

Take a "trial day off" before real vacation:
- Stay home, don't go to shop
- See what issues arise
- Identify gaps in processes/employee training
- Fix gaps, then try again

**By the time you take real vacation, systems are proven.**

**5. Embrace Imperfection:**

Something WILL go wrong while you're away. Accept it.

- Employee will make a mistake
- Minor crisis will occur
- You'll miss an opportunity

**It's okay.** Cost of these issues < cost of burnout.

### Types of Time Off

**Daily Boundaries:**
- Leave shop by 6 PM (enforce hard stop)
- No work email after 7 PM
- No shop work on Sundays

**Weekly Boundaries:**
- One full weekend off per month
- Friday afternoon off occasionally

**Annual Vacations:**
- 1 week per year minimum (once established)
- 2 weeks per year ideal (by Year 5+)

**Personal Days:**
- Kids' school events, sports games
- Doctor appointments (don't skip healthcare)
- Mental health days (when burned out, take a day to recharge)

### The Guilt-Free Vacation Mindset

**Reframe Vacation:**

Not: "I'm abandoning my business"
But: "I'm recharging so I can lead effectively"

Not: "I'm wasting money (lost production)"
But: "I'm investing in my health and longevity"

Not: "I'm being selfish"
But: "I'm modeling healthy behavior for employees and family"

**Successful long-term owners prioritize sustainability over short-term hustle.**

## 17.4 Family Involvement and Boundaries

### The Family Business Dilemma

**Advantages of Family Involvement:**
- ✅ Shared purpose and legacy
- ✅ Trust (family vs. strangers)
- ✅ Flexibility (informal arrangements)
- ✅ Cost savings (family may work cheaper or defer compensation)

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Blurred boundaries (work invades home life)
- ❌ Relationship strain (business conflicts damage family relationships)
- ❌ Difficult to fire or discipline
- ❌ Non-family employees may resent favoritism
- ❌ Succession conflicts

### Common Family Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Spouse as Business Partner**

**Works Well When:**
- Clearly defined roles (one handles operations, other handles admin/bookkeeping)
- Mutual respect for each other's domain
- Ability to separate business and personal relationship
- Both genuinely want involvement

**Fails When:**
- Disagreements about business spill into marriage
- One spouse forced into role they don't want
- Decision-making conflicts (who has final say?)
- Resentment over workload or compensation

**Tips for Success:**
- **Define roles clearly** (in writing)
- **Regular "state of the business" meetings** separate from personal time
- **No business talk after 8 PM** or during family meals
- **Exit plan:** What if one spouse wants out?

**Scenario 2: Spouse Handles Bookkeeping (Part-Time)**

**Very common and often successful:**
- Spouse handles invoicing, payables, payroll, bookkeeping (10-20 hrs/week)
- Owner focuses on production and sales
- Keeps money "in family"
- Flexible schedule

**Challenges:**
- Mixing business and personal finances (clarity needed)
- Tax implications (legitimate compensation vs. expense shifting)
- Relationship strain if spouse dislikes bookkeeping

**Scenario 3: Kids in the Business**

**Teenagers/Young Adults:**

**Pros:**
- Teach work ethic and skills
- Earn money for college
- Potential successor

**Cons:**
- Nepotism perception (especially if overpaid or underworked)
- Parent-child relationship strain
- May not be interested in machining

**Best Practices:**
- Pay fair wage (not inflated or unpaid)
- Expect same work quality as non-family employee
- Don't force involvement (respect if they choose another path)
- Start in low-skill roles (cleaning, organizing, deburring), promote based on merit

**Adult Children as Successors:**

See Section 17.6 (Planning Your Exit) for succession planning details.

**Scenario 4: Extended Family (Siblings, Parents, Cousins)**

**High risk:**
- Family dynamics complicate business decisions
- Difficult to fire
- Compensation conflicts
- Ownership/profit-sharing disputes

**Only if:**
- Formal employment agreement (treat like any employee)
- Clear performance expectations
- Exit plan (how to part ways if not working)

### Setting Boundaries

**Physical Boundaries:**
- Don't bring work home (if possible)
- Separate home office from living space
- No shop equipment in home garage (boundary reinforcement)

**Time Boundaries:**
- Designate "family time" (no phone/email)
- Attend important family events (kids' games, spouse's events) without work interruptions
- "Business hours" even if you own business (e.g., no customer calls after 7 PM)

**Emotional Boundaries:**
- Don't vent business frustrations to spouse/kids constantly
- Protect family from business stress when possible
- Seek external support (peer groups, therapist) for business stress

**Financial Boundaries:**
- Separate business and personal bank accounts (legally required for LLC/Corp)
- Pay yourself a defined salary (don't just raid business account)
- Don't risk family home/savings without spouse's full understanding and consent

### Protecting Relationships

**Marriage:**

Business ownership strains marriages:
- Long hours → less time together
- Financial stress → arguments
- Owner's obsession with business → spouse feels neglected
- Disagreements about business decisions

**Strategies:**
- **Regular date nights** (no business talk)
- **Include spouse in major decisions** (respect partnership)
- **Express appreciation** (acknowledge sacrifices spouse makes)
- **Couples counseling** if strain is high (proactive, not crisis-only)

**Children:**

Kids don't understand "Daddy/Mommy is building a business." They understand "Daddy/Mommy is never home."

**Strategies:**
- **Prioritize key events** (birthday parties, games, recitals) → non-negotiable
- **Quality time over quantity** (present and engaged, not distracted by phone)
- **Explain in age-appropriate terms** why you work hard
- **Include them occasionally** (visit shop, see what you make) → helps them understand

**Friendships:**

Owners often lose friendships—no time for social life.

**Strategies:**
- **Schedule friend time** (monthly dinner, golf, etc.)
- **Join business/peer groups** (combine networking and socializing)
- **Accept that friendships evolve** (fewer but deeper relationships)

## 17.5 Avoiding Burnout

### What is Burnout?

**Burnout:** State of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion caused by prolonged stress and overwork.

**Symptoms:**
- Chronic fatigue (tired all the time, even after sleep)
- Cynicism and detachment ("I don't care anymore")
- Reduced performance (making mistakes, forgetting things)
- Irritability and mood swings
- Physical symptoms (headaches, insomnia, stomach issues)
- Loss of motivation ("Why am I doing this?")
- Depression and anxiety

**Burnout is common among business owners.** Studies show 50-60% of small business owners experience burnout.

### Causes of Burnout in CNC Business Owners

**1. Relentless Workload:**
- 60-80 hour weeks for years
- No vacation or breaks
- Constant "on call" mentality

**2. Financial Stress:**
- Cash flow crises
- Debt burden
- Fear of failure

**3. Lack of Control (Ironically):**
- Despite "being the boss," external pressures (customers, suppliers, economy) limit control
- Feeling trapped by business obligations

**4. Isolation:**
- Lonely at the top (can't confide in employees)
- Lost friendships due to work demands
- No peer support

**5. Perfectionism:**
- Unrealistic standards
- Never satisfied with performance
- Self-criticism

**6. Loss of Purpose:**
- Started business for passion/freedom
- Now feels like prison
- Forgotten "why"

### Preventing Burnout

**Strategy 1: Pace Yourself (Marathon, Not Sprint)**

Accept that business building takes 5-10 years. Don't destroy yourself in Year 1.

- Work hard but sustainably (60 hrs/week, not 80)
- Take at least one full day off per week
- Prioritize sleep (7-8 hours minimum)

**Strategy 2: Build Support Systems**

**Business Peer Groups:**
- Join NTMA, local machining association, or mastermind group
- Monthly meetings with other shop owners
- Share challenges, advice, support

**Personal Support:**
- Maintain friendships (even if limited time)
- Stay connected with spouse/family
- Consider therapist or coach (professional support)

**Strategy 3: Maintain Physical Health**

Owners neglect health—skip exercise, eat poorly, ignore medical issues.

**Impact:** Declining health reduces energy, decision-making ability, and longevity.

**Strategies:**
- **Exercise:** 30 min, 3-5x per week (even walks help)
- **Nutrition:** Avoid living on fast food and coffee (meal prep or hire spouse/service)
- **Sleep:** 7-8 hours non-negotiable (lack of sleep destroys performance)
- **Medical:** Annual checkups, don't ignore symptoms

**Strategy 4: Reconnect with Purpose**

**When burned out, ask:**
- Why did I start this business?
- What did I hope to achieve?
- Am I still pursuing that vision, or just surviving?

**If answer is "just surviving,"** consider:
- Pivoting strategy
- Selling business
- Taking extended break (if possible)

**Purpose-driven work sustains energy. Meaningless grind causes burnout.**

**Strategy 5: Set Boundaries (See 17.3)**

Enforce time off, family time, and personal hobbies.

**Strategy 6: Delegate and Hire (See 17.2)**

Burnout often stems from doing too much yourself. Hiring is not just business growth—it's burnout prevention.

**Strategy 7: Celebrate Wins**

Owners focus on problems (what's wrong, what's next). Rarely celebrate achievements.

**Practice:**
- Monthly: Reflect on accomplishments (jobs completed, customers gained, revenue milestones)
- Annual: Review year's progress (you've likely achieved more than you realize)
- Share wins with family (help them see the purpose behind sacrifices)

### Recovering from Burnout

**If Already Burned Out:**

**1. Acknowledge It:**
Don't deny or push through—burnout worsens without intervention.

**2. Take a Break (If Possible):**
- Even 1 week off can help
- If can't leave business, reduce hours (e.g., 40 hrs/week for a month)

**3. Seek Professional Help:**
- Therapist or counselor (mental health professional)
- Business coach (restructure operations)
- Physician (rule out medical issues, consider medication if depression present)

**4. Make Changes:**
Burnout signals something is unsustainable. What must change?
- Hire help
- Raise prices (reduce workload and stress)
- Fire difficult customers
- Simplify offerings (stop doing everything)
- Set boundaries

**5. Consider Exit (If Necessary):**

If burnout is severe and changes don't help, consider:
- Selling business
- Bringing in partner to share load
- Transitioning to part-time role
- Closing business

**Your health and life matter more than the business.** Don't sacrifice yourself for a company.

## 17.6 Planning Your Exit

### Why Think About Exit Now?

**"I just started—why think about exit?"**

Because:
1. **Exit planning influences current decisions** (business structure, systems, documentation)
2. **Best exits are planned 5-10 years in advance** (not scrambled together last-minute)
3. **Exit strategy affects valuation** (businesses built to sell are worth more)
4. **Peace of mind** (knowing there's an eventual path out reduces stress)

**You won't own this business forever.** Eventually, you'll:
- Retire
- Sell
- Pass to family
- Shut down

**Better to choose your exit than have it forced by health crisis, burnout, or market collapse.**

### Exit Options

**Option 1: Sell to Outside Buyer**

**Strategic Buyer:** Another machining business (competitor or complementary shop) buys you to:
- Expand capacity
- Acquire customers
- Gain capabilities

**Financial Buyer:** Individual or investment group buys business to:
- Own and operate
- Generate income

**Typical Valuation:**

**CNC Job Shops:** Typically sell for **2-4× SDE (Seller's Discretionary Earnings)** or **3-5× EBITDA**.

**SDE:** Profit + owner salary + owner benefits + interest + taxes + depreciation + one-time expenses

**Example:**

```
Small CNC Shop:
Revenue: $800,000
Owner salary: $80,000
Net profit: $50,000
Interest: $10,000
Depreciation: $20,000
SDE: $80K + $50K + $10K + $20K = $160,000

Valuation: $160,000 × 3 = $480,000

After broker fees (10%), loans paid off, etc.: Owner nets ~$350,000-400,000
```

**Factors Increasing Value:**
- ✅ Diversified customer base (no single customer >20%)
- ✅ Documented processes and systems
- ✅ Trained employees (business runs without owner)
- ✅ Modern equipment (well-maintained)
- ✅ Strong financials (clean books, profitable, growing)
- ✅ Long-term contracts or recurring revenue

**Factors Decreasing Value:**
- ❌ Owner-dependent (business collapses without owner)
- ❌ Concentrated customer base (one customer = 60% revenue)
- ❌ Old equipment or deferred maintenance
- ❌ Poor financials or declining revenue
- ❌ Legal/compliance issues

**Timeline:** 6-18 months to sell (finding buyer, due diligence, transition)

**Option 2: Pass to Family (Succession)**

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Keep business in family (legacy)
- ✅ Provide career/income for child
- ✅ Can structure gradually (over years)

**Challenges:**
- ❌ Is child interested and capable?
- ❌ How to compensate owner fairly (gifted vs. paid over time)?
- ❌ Sibling conflicts (if multiple kids, one gets business)
- ❌ Tax implications (estate tax, gift tax)

**Best Practices:**

**1. Start Early (5-10 years before retirement):**
- Involve child in business (entry-level → management)
- Assess ability and interest (don't force)
- Train extensively

**2. Formalize Transition:**
- Written succession plan
- Ownership transfer schedule (e.g., 20% per year over 5 years)
- Compensation structure (salary vs. profit distributions)

**3. Professional Guidance:**
- Attorney (legal structure)
- Accountant (tax optimization)
- Mediator (family dynamics)

**4. Treat Fairly (If Multiple Children):**
- Child in business receives company (sweat equity)
- Other children receive other assets (cash, property) or buyout over time

**5. Plan for Unexpected:**
- What if owner dies suddenly? (Life insurance, succession plan in place)
- What if child wants out after 5 years?

**Option 3: Sell to Employees (ESOP or Management Buyout)**

**Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP):**
- Employees acquire ownership over time
- Tax advantages
- Complex and expensive to set up (typically for larger businesses, >$2M revenue)

**Management Buyout:**
- Key employee(s) buy business
- Financed by owner (seller financing), SBA loan, or combination
- Lower sale price than outside buyer typically

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Reward loyal employees
- ✅ Business continuity (employees already know operations)
- ✅ Owner can stay involved part-time during transition

**Challenges:**
- ❌ Employees often lack capital for down payment
- ❌ Owner carries risk (if seller-financed and business fails, may not get paid)

**Option 4: Wind Down and Close**

**"Lifestyle Exit":**
- Gradually reduce work (fewer customers, fewer employees)
- Sell equipment piece by piece
- Close shop and retire

**When This Makes Sense:**
- Business too small/owner-dependent to sell
- Owner has retirement savings (doesn't need business sale proceeds)
- No interested buyers or successors

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Zero equity value (no sale proceeds)
- ❌ Employees lose jobs
- ❌ Wasted potential (if business has value)

**Better Than:** Running business into the ground or dying at the machine.

### Preparing for Exit (Now)

**Even if exit is 10-20 years away, start now:**

**1. Build Systems and Documentation:**
- SOPs for all processes
- Customer and supplier lists maintained digitally
- Documented CAM programs and job history
- Quality procedures

**2. Reduce Owner Dependency:**
- Train employees to handle tasks
- Delegate decision-making
- Take vacations (prove business runs without you)

**3. Maintain Clean Financials:**
- Use proper accounting software (QuickBooks, etc.)
- Separate business and personal expenses (no mixing)
- Annual financial statements (professionally prepared)
- Tax returns up-to-date

**4. Invest in Relationships:**
- Strong customer relationships (but not owner-dependent)
- Good employee morale
- Vendor relationships

**5. Keep Equipment Modern:**
- Don't let equipment become obsolete
- Maintain well (deferred maintenance hurts value)

**6. Diversify Customer Base:**
- Target 10+ customers (no single >20% revenue)

**7. Consult Professionals:**
- CPA (tax and financial planning)
- Attorney (business structure, succession)
- Business broker or M&A advisor (when ready to sell)

### Timeline for Exit

**10 Years Before Retirement:**
- Begin documenting systems
- Reduce owner dependency
- Consider succession (family or employee)

**5 Years Before:**
- Intensify systems building
- Hire/train successor (if family or management buyout)
- Consult business broker (valuation, prepare for sale)

**3 Years Before:**
- Clean up financials
- Address equipment/facility issues
- Maximize profitability (increases valuation)

**1-2 Years Before:**
- List business for sale (if outside buyer)
- Marketing to potential buyers
- Due diligence preparation

**Exit Year:**
- Close sale or transition ownership
- Train buyer/successor
- Celebrate 🎉

## Conclusion

Work-life balance as a CNC business owner is difficult but essential. Long hours, stress, and sacrifice are inevitable—especially in the early years—but burnout is not. Successful long-term owners pace themselves, delegate effectively, take time off, protect relationships, and plan their eventual exit.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Expect Long Hours Initially:** 60-80 hours/week in Year 1 is normal. But have a plan to reduce over time.

2. **Delegate or Burn Out:** You cannot do everything forever. Hiring and delegating are essential for balance and growth.

3. **Taking Time Off is Not Optional:** Vacations, weekends, and daily boundaries protect your health, relationships, and decision-making ability.

4. **Set Boundaries with Family:** Involve family thoughtfully (not by default), and protect family time from business invasion.

5. **Prevent Burnout Proactively:** Join peer groups, maintain health, reconnect with purpose, and celebrate wins. Don't wait until burned out.

6. **Plan Your Exit Now:** Even if 20 years away, build systems, reduce dependency, and maintain clean books to maximize future value and options.

7. **Your Life > Your Business:** The business exists to serve your life goals—not the other way around. If ownership destroys your health, relationships, or happiness, reevaluate.

**Ownership is a marathon, not a sprint. Pace yourself. Build sustainably. Enjoy the journey, not just the destination.**
