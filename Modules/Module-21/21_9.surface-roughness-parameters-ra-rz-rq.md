# Module 21 – Metrology and Precision Measurement


Surface finish affects part function, appearance, wear characteristics, fatigue life, corrosion resistance, and assembly fit. Measuring and controlling surface texture is essential for quality manufacturing.

## 21.9.1 Surface Roughness Parameters (Ra, Rz, Rq)

Surface texture consists of irregularities created by the manufacturing process. Multiple parameters quantify different aspects of the surface.

### Surface Texture Components

**Roughness**: Fine irregularities from the manufacturing process (tool marks, feed marks)
- Wavelength: < 0.8 mm typically
- Amplitude: Micrometers to nanometers

**Waviness**: Longer wavelength deviations (machine vibration, workpiece deflection, heat treatment)
- Wavelength: 0.8 mm to several mm
- Amplitude: Typically larger than roughness

**Form**: Overall shape of the surface (flatness, straightness, roundness)
- Wavelength: Entire part surface
- Removed by filtering for roughness measurement

**Lay**: Predominant direction of surface pattern (parallel, perpendicular, circular, etc.)

### Common Roughness Parameters

**Ra (Arithmetic Average Roughness)**:

Most widely used parameter worldwide.

**Definition**: Average absolute deviation of roughness profile from mean line

**Formula**:
```
Ra = (1/L) ∫|y(x)| dx
```

Where:
- L = Evaluation length
- y = Profile height deviation from mean line

**Units**: micrometers (μm), microinches (μin)

**Typical Values**:
- Rough machining: Ra = 6-25 μm (250-1000 μin)
- General machining: Ra = 1.6-6 μm (63-250 μin)
- Fine machining: Ra = 0.4-1.6 μm (16-63 μin)
- Grinding: Ra = 0.1-0.8 μm (4-32 μin)
- Lapping: Ra = 0.01-0.1 μm (0.4-4 μin)

**Advantages**: Simple, well-understood, widely specified

**Limitations**: Doesn't distinguish peaks from valleys, insensitive to occasional high peaks

**Rz (Average Maximum Height)**:

**Definition** (ISO 4287): Average of absolute values of five highest peaks and five lowest valleys within evaluation length

**Formula**:
```
Rz = (Σ|Rpi| + Σ|Rvi|) / 5
```

Where:
- Rpi = Peak heights
- Rvi = Valley depths

**Alternative** (older definition): Maximum peak-to-valley height (Rt or Rmax)

**Advantages**: More sensitive to extreme peaks/valleys than Ra

**Applications**: Important when peaks might scratch mating surfaces or when valleys affect sealing

**Typical Relationship**: Rz ≈ 4-8 × Ra (varies with process)

**Rq (Root Mean Square Roughness)**:

**Definition**: RMS average of profile height deviations

**Formula**:
```
Rq = √[(1/L) ∫y²(x) dx]
```

**Characteristics**:
- Always slightly larger than Ra (typically Rq ≈ 1.1 × Ra)
- More sensitive to peaks and valleys than Ra
- Used in theoretical analysis and optical measurements

**Rt (Total Height)**:

**Definition**: Maximum peak-to-valley height over evaluation length

**Characteristics**:
- Most severe parameter
- Varies significantly with evaluation length
- Sensitive to measurement noise and anomalies

### Additional Parameters

**RSm (Mean Spacing of Profile Irregularities)**:
- Average spacing between peaks
- Important for lubrication and wear

**Rsk (Skewness)**:
- Symmetry of profile
- Positive: Sharp peaks
- Negative: Deep valleys

**Rku (Kurtosis)**:
- Sharpness of profile
- High: Spiky surface
- Low: Bumpy surface

### Evaluation Length and Cutoff

**Cutoff Length (λc)**: Wavelength that separates roughness from waviness
- Standard values: 0.08, 0.25, 0.8, 2.5, 8.0 mm
- Selection based on expected roughness

**Evaluation Length (ln)**: Total length over which parameters are calculated
- Typically 5× cutoff length
- ln = 5 × λc

**Example**: For Ra = 1.6 μm surface
- Cutoff: λc = 0.8 mm
- Evaluation length: ln = 4.0 mm

## 21.9.2 Waviness and Form Separation

Proper filtering separates roughness, waviness, and form for meaningful measurement.

### Filtering Process

**Raw Profile**: Contains form, waviness, and roughness

**High-Pass Filter**: Removes waviness and form, leaves roughness
- Cutoff wavelength λc
- Result: Roughness profile

**Low-Pass Filter**: Removes roughness, leaves waviness and form
- Cutoff wavelength λf (typically 10-20× λc)
- Result: Waviness profile

### Waviness Parameters

Similar to roughness but with longer cutoff:

**Wa**: Average waviness (analogous to Ra)

**Wt**: Total waviness height (analogous to Rt)

**Typical Causes**:
- Machine vibration
- Spindle runout
- Workpiece deflection
- Tool chatter
- Regenerative vibration

### Combined Symbols

Drawing callouts may specify both roughness and waviness:

**Example**:
```
Ra 1.6
Wa 0.05
```
Means: Ra ≤ 1.6 μm, Wa ≤ 0.05 mm

## 21.9.3 Contact vs. Non-Contact Methods

### Contact Profilometry

**Stylus Profilometer**:

**Components**:
- Diamond stylus (typically 2-10 μm radius, 60-90° cone angle)
- Precision linear stage
- Inductive or optical displacement transducer
- Signal processing and filtering

**Operation**:
1. Stylus contacts surface with light force (0.7-4 mN typical)
2. Traverse surface at constant speed (0.5 mm/s typical)
3. Vertical displacement recorded
4. Profile digitized and filtered
5. Parameters calculated

**Advantages**:
- Well-established technology

**Typical Specifications**:
- Vertical resolution: 0.01-1 nm
- Vertical range: 1-10 mm
- Horizontal resolution: 0.01-1 μm
- Traverse length: 1-300 mm

### Non-Contact Optical Methods

**White Light Interferometry**:

**Principle**: Uses interference fringes from white light to measure height

**Characteristics**:
- Vertical resolution: Sub-nanometer
- 3D surface maps (not just line profiles)
- Very fast measurement (seconds)
- Ideal for smooth surfaces

**Applications**: Polished surfaces, optics, silicon wafers, fine grinding

**Laser Triangulation**:

## 21.9.4 Effect of Machining Parameters on Surface Finish

Surface finish is directly influenced by machining conditions.

### Milling and Turning

**Theoretical Surface Roughness** (Turning):

```
Ra_theoretical = f² / (32 × r)
```

Where:
- f = feed per revolution (mm/rev)
- r = tool nose radius (mm)

**Example**: Feed = 0.2 mm/rev, nose radius = 0.8 mm
```
Ra = (0.2)² / (32 × 0.8) = 0.04 / 25.6 = 1.56 μm (61 μin)
```

**Milling** (similar relationship):
```
Ra_theoretical ≈ fz² / (8 × r)
```

Where fz = feed per tooth

**Actual vs. Theoretical**:

Actual surface finish is worse due to:
- Tool wear
- Built-up edge (BUE)
- Vibration
- Material properties
- Cutting conditions

**Typical**: Actual Ra = 2-5× theoretical Ra

### Key Factors Affecting Finish

**Feed Rate**:
- Lower feed → Better finish
- Most significant controllable parameter
- Quadratic relationship (halving feed reduces Ra by 4×)

**Tool Nose Radius**:
- Larger radius → Better finish
- But increases cutting forces and risk of chatter

**Cutting Speed**:
- Too low: Built-up edge (poor finish)
- Optimal range: Good finish
- Too high: Excessive wear (poor finish)

**Tool Wear**:
- Fresh tool: Good finish
- Moderate wear: Often improved finish (burnishing)
- Excessive wear: Poor finish, work hardening

**Depth of Cut**:
- Minimal direct effect on finish
- Affects forces and potential deflection

**Coolant/Lubrication**:
- Proper coolant: Reduces BUE, improves finish
- Inadequate: Heat, BUE, poor finish

**Machine Rigidity**:
- Rigid setup: Minimal vibration, good finish
- Lack of rigidity: Chatter, poor finish

### Improving Surface Finish

**Machining Strategies**:

1. **Reduce feed rate**: Most effective but increases cycle time
2. **Increase nose radius**: Within limits of tool strength and chatter resistance
3. **Optimize cutting speed**: Avoid BUE formation range
4. **Use sharp tools**: Replace worn tools promptly
5. **Proper coolant**: Type and application method
6. **Finishing passes**: Light depth, low feed, high speed
7. **Tool geometry**: Positive rake, sharp edge, honed radius

**Advanced Techniques**:

**High-Speed Machining**:
- Very high speeds with small chip loads
- Excellent finish on aluminum and other materials

**Burnishing**:
- Post-machining rolling operation
- Plastic deformation smooths surface
- Can achieve Ra < 0.2 μm from Ra 3-6 μm

**Vibratory Finishing**:
- Abrasive media tumbling
- Uniform finish on complex parts

## Summary

Surface finish measurement quantifies the texture resulting from manufacturing processes. Multiple parameters (Ra, Rz, Rq) characterize different aspects. Contact stylus profilometers are the standard method, while optical methods offer non-contact 3D measurement. Waviness and form must be separated from roughness by proper filtering. Machining parameters—especially feed rate and tool geometry—directly affect surface finish. Understanding these relationships enables optimization of processes to achieve required finish while minimizing cycle time.
