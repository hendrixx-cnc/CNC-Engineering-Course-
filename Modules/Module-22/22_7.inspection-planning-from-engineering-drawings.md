## 22.7.1 Inspection Planning from Engineering Drawings

Effective inspection begins with understanding what to inspect and how to interpret engineering requirements.

### Reading and Interpreting Drawings

**Key Drawing Elements for Inspection**:

**Title Block**:
- Part number and revision level
- Material specification
- Finish requirements (plating, coating, heat treatment)
- Scale
- Drawing standards referenced (ASME Y14.5, ISO 1101, etc.)

**Dimensions and Tolerances**:
- Linear dimensions (lengths, diameters, widths)
- Angular dimensions
- Tolerances (bilateral, unilateral, limit dimensions)
- General tolerances (tolerance block)

**Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T)**:
- Feature control frames
- Datums and datum reference frames
- Geometric tolerances (flatness, perpendicularity, position, profile, etc.)
- Material condition modifiers (MMC, LMC, RFS)

**Surface Finish**:
- Surface roughness symbols (Ra, Rz values)
- Lay direction
- Surface texture requirements

**Notes and Specifications**:
- General notes (break sharp edges, deburr, clean, etc.)
- Material specifications (ASTM, AMS, SAE standards)
- Process requirements (heat treatment, plating, coating per specific spec)
- Inspection requirements (100% inspection, sampling, FAI, source inspection)
- Customer-specific requirements

**Revisions**:
- Revision history block
- Revision clouds or triangles indicating changes
- **Critical**: Always inspect to current revision

### Identifying Critical Characteristics

**Characteristic Classification**:

**Critical Characteristics** (safety, regulatory, or functional importance):
- Identified with special symbols: 🔺 (triangle), ⬥ (diamond), or "KEY" notation
- Affect safety, fit, or function
- Require enhanced controls (100% inspection, SPC, special processes)
- Typically customer-designated

**Major Characteristics**:
- Affect fit, function, or performance
- Require standard controls (inspection per control plan)

**Minor Characteristics**:
- Less critical dimensions
- Periodic sampling acceptable

**Example Critical Characteristics**:
- Hole pattern for mounting (affects assembly)
- Bearing bore diameter (affects fit and function)
- Wall thickness (affects strength, safety)
- Surface finish on sealing surface (affects performance)

### Creating Inspection Plans

**Inspection Plan Development**:

1. **Review Drawing and Specifications**:
   - Identify all dimensions, tolerances, GD&T, finishes, notes
   - Note critical and key characteristics

2. **List All Characteristics to Inspect**:
   - Every dimension and requirement from drawing
   - Number characteristics sequentially (balloon numbers)

3. **Prioritize Characteristics**:
   - Critical: 100% inspection or tight sampling
   - Major: Sample inspection per control plan
   - Minor: Periodic checks

4. **Select Inspection Methods**:
   - What equipment/gages needed (micrometer, CMM, gage, visual)
   - Who performs inspection (operator, inspector, CMM operator)

5. **Determine Frequency**:
   - When to inspect (first-off, in-process, final)
   - Sample size and frequency (every part, 1 per 10, hourly, etc.)

6. **Define Acceptance Criteria**:
   - Tolerance from drawing
   - Pass/fail criteria for visual or functional checks

7. **Document in Control Plan**:
   - Formalize inspection plan in control plan (covered in Section 22.4.5)

## 22.7.2 In-Process Inspection

**In-Process Inspection**: Inspection performed during manufacturing (between operations) to verify conformance before proceeding.

### Purpose of In-Process Inspection

**Catch Problems Early**:
- Detect nonconformances before additional work added
- Prevent scrapping finished parts (expensive machining already completed)
- Reduce rework (easier to correct at intermediate stage)

**Verify Process Control**:
- Confirm setup remains correct
- Detect tool wear or process drift
- Enable adjustments before defects produced

**Example Value**:
- 5-operation part, defect occurs in Operation 2
- If caught at Operation 2: Scrap value = material + Op 1-2 labor (~$50)
- If caught at final inspection: Scrap value = material + all operations labor (~$200)
- **In-process inspection saves $150 per scrapped part**

### When to Perform In-Process Inspection

**Strategic Inspection Points**:

**After Critical Operations**:
- Operations affecting critical characteristics
- Operations difficult or impossible to inspect later (features hidden by subsequent machining)

**Before Expensive Operations**:
- Inspect before costly operation (multi-axis machining, EDM, coating)
- Avoid adding value to defective part

**After Setup-Dependent Features**:
- Features controlled by setup (hole locations, work offsets)
- Verify setup correct before continuing

**Before Irreversible Operations**:
- Heat treatment (cannot undo)
- Welding
- Coating

**At Process Capability Limits**:
- Operations with low Cpk or history of problems
- More frequent inspection to monitor stability

**Example In-Process Inspection Points**:

**Shaft Machining (4 operations)**:
1. **Op 1**: Turn OD and face ends
   - *In-process check*: Diameter and length (setup-dependent, critical dimensions)
2. **Op 2**: Drill and ream bore
   - *In-process check*: Bore diameter (critical fit dimension, difficult to inspect after Op 3)
3. **Op 3**: Mill keyway
   - *In-process check*: Keyway dimensions (before expensive Op 4)
4. **Op 4**: Grind OD (final finish)
   - *Final inspection*: All dimensions

### In-Process Inspection Methods

**Operator Self-Inspection**:
- Operator performs checks using gages at workstation
- Quick checks (go/no-go gages, calipers, height gage)
- Documented on traveler or in-process log

**Roving Inspector**:
- Inspector circulates through shop floor
- Checks in-process parts periodically
- Observes processes and verifies control

**Dedicated In-Process Inspection Station**:
- Parts delivered to inspection area between operations
- More thorough inspection (CMM, precision gages)
- Formal approval before next operation

**Automated In-Process Measurement**:
- On-machine probing (measure features without removing part)
- Laser measurement (real-time monitoring)
- Vision systems (automated inspection)

### In-Process Inspection Documentation

**Traveler/Router**:
- Lists operations and inspection checks
- Operator or inspector records results
- Signatures and dates

**In-Process Inspection Form**:
- Dedicated form for recording in-process checks
- Part identification, operation, date, operator/inspector
- Characteristics inspected and results
- Accept/reject decision

**Example Traveler Section**:

## 22.7.3 Final Inspection and Testing

**Final Inspection**: Comprehensive inspection performed after all manufacturing operations complete, before release to customer.

### Purpose of Final Inspection

**Verify Conformance**:
- Ensure all requirements met (dimensions, finish, appearance, function)
- Catch any defects missed by in-process inspection

**Release Authorization**:
- Formal approval to ship
- Evidence of conformance for customer

**Quality Assurance**:
- Final check before product leaves facility
- Protects company reputation and reduces returns

### Final Inspection Scope

**What to Inspect**:

**Dimensional Inspection**:
- All critical and key dimensions
- Sample of minor dimensions (per control plan)
- GD&T characteristics (using appropriate methods: CMM, gage, functional gage)

**Visual Inspection**:
- Surface defects (scratches, dents, burrs, cracks)
- Finish quality (plating, coating, paint)
- Cleanliness
- Identification (markings, labels)

**Functional Testing** (if applicable):
- Assemblies: Fit, function, operation

- In-process inspections passed
- Special process certifications received (heat treatment, plating, NDT)
- Material certifications present (if traceability required)

**Packaging**:
- Properly packaged to prevent damage
- Labeled correctly (part number, quantity, customer info)
- Handling instructions included (if applicable)

### Final Inspection Methods

**Manual Inspection**:
- Inspector uses hand tools (micrometers, calipers, gages, visual aids)
- Records results on inspection report
- Time-intensive but versatile

**Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM)**:
- Automated dimensional inspection (especially for complex GD&T)
- Generates detailed reports
- Fast and accurate for complex parts

**Functional Gages**:
- Go/no-go gages (quick pass/fail check)
- Functional fixtures (simulate assembly fit)

**Automated Optical Inspection**:
- Vision systems scan parts for defects
- Fast for high-volume production
- Requires programming and setup

### Sampling vs. 100% Inspection

**100% Inspection**:
- Inspect every part, every characteristic
- **When Required**:
  - Critical characteristics affecting safety or function
  - Incapable process (Cpk < 1.0)
  - Customer requirement
  - High-value, low-volume parts
  - Regulatory requirement (aerospace, medical)

**Sampling Inspection**:
- Inspect representative sample from lot
- **When Acceptable**:
  - Capable process (Cpk ≥ 1.33)
  - Non-critical characteristics
  - High-volume production (100% inspection impractical or costly)
- **Sample Size**: Determined by statistical sampling plan (see Section 22.7.5)

**Risk-Based Approach**:
- Critical characteristics: 100% inspection or tight sampling
- Major characteristics: Standard sampling
- Minor characteristics: Reduced sampling or periodic checks

### Final Inspection Documentation

**Inspection Report**:
- Formal record of inspection results
- **Contents**:
  - Part identification (part number, serial number, lot number, quantity)
  - Drawing number and revision
  - Date of inspection
  - Inspector name/signature
  - Characteristics inspected (dimensions, visual, functional)
  - Results (measurements, pass/fail)
  - Overall accept/reject decision
  - Disposition (released to stock, released to ship, hold, reject)

**Certificate of Conformance (C of C)**:

## 22.7.4 First Article Inspection (FAI)

First Article Inspection verifies that manufacturing processes can produce parts meeting all design requirements. Covered in detail in Section 22.3.1.3 (AS9102), but reinforced here as general quality practice.

### FAI Applications Beyond Aerospace

While AS9102 is aerospace-specific, FAI principles apply broadly:

**When to Perform FAI** (any industry):
- New part introduction
- Engineering change affecting form, fit, function
- New or significantly modified manufacturing process
- Change in supplier or manufacturing location
- After extended production break (>1 year)
- Customer request

**FAI Benefits**:
- Validates manufacturing process before production
- Catches design or manufacturing issues early
- Provides confidence to customer
- Reduces risk of producing nonconforming lots

### FAI Documentation (General Practice)

**Even Without AS9102 Requirement**:
- Document comprehensive inspection of first production part(s)
- Measure all dimensions and characteristics
- Verify material, finishes, processes
- Retain as baseline for future reference

**FAI Report Contents**:
- Part identification
- Drawing and specification references
- Sample size inspected
- Detailed inspection results (all characteristics)
- Material and process certifications
- Photos (if helpful)
- Accept/release decision
- Approval signatures (quality, engineering, customer if required)

---

## 22.7.5 Sample Size Determination (ANSI/ASQ Z1.4, MIL-STD-105E)

Statistical sampling plans determine how many parts to inspect from a lot to gain confidence in lot quality.

### Acceptance Sampling Overview

**Purpose**:
- Inspect sample from lot, accept or reject entire lot based on sample results
- Balance risk and cost (100% inspection costly; no inspection risky)

**Acceptance Sampling Is NOT**:
- Process control (SPC charts control processes)
- Quality improvement (acceptance sampling only sorts good from bad)
- Substitute for capable process (should still aim for Cpk ≥ 1.33)

**Acceptance Sampling IS**:
- Lot disposition tool (accept or reject lot)
- Risk management (balance producer and consumer risk)
- Economical alternative to 100% inspection

### ANSI/ASQ Z1.4 Standard

**ANSI/ASQ Z1.4** (formerly MIL-STD-105E): Most widely used acceptance sampling standard

**Sampling Plan Elements**:
- **Lot Size (N)**: Number of parts in lot
- **Sample Size (n)**: Number of parts inspected from lot
- **Acceptance Number (Ac)**: Maximum defects allowed in sample to accept lot
- **Rejection Number (Re)**: Minimum defects in sample to reject lot

**Inspection Levels**:
- **General Inspection Levels**:
  - Level I: Reduced sample size (less inspection, higher risk)
  - **Level II**: Standard (most commonly used)
  - Level III: Increased sample size (more inspection, lower risk)
- **Special Inspection Levels** (S-1, S-2, S-3, S-4): Very small samples (use only when small samples justified)

**Inspection Types**:
- **Normal Inspection**: Standard sampling (use at start and when quality acceptable)
- **Tightened Inspection**: Stricter sampling (use when quality deteriorates; 2 of 5 lots rejected on normal)
- **Reduced Inspection**: Relaxed sampling (use when quality excellent; 10 consecutive lots accepted on normal, optional)

### Acceptable Quality Limit (AQL)

**AQL**: Maximum percent defective (or defects per hundred units) considered acceptable as a process average

**Common AQL Values**:
- **0.065, 0.10, 0.15**: Very critical (aerospace, medical, safety-critical)
- **0.25, 0.40, 0.65**: Critical characteristics
- **1.0, 1.5, 2.5**: Major characteristics
- **4.0, 6.5**: Minor characteristics

**AQL Interpretation**:
- AQL 1.0 means: Accept long-term average of 1% defective
- Does NOT mean: Accept any lot with ≤1% defective (individual lot may have more or less)

### Using ANSI/ASQ Z1.4

**Steps to Determine Sampling Plan**:

1. **Determine Lot Size (N)**: Count of parts in lot (e.g., 500 pieces)

2. **Select Inspection Level**: Usually **Level II** (General Inspection Level II)

3. **Choose AQL**: Based on characteristic criticality (e.g., AQL 1.0 for major characteristic)

4. **Find Sample Size Code Letter**: Use Table I in Z1.4
   - Lot Size 500, Inspection Level II → Code Letter **H**

5. **Find Sampling Plan**: Use Table II-A (single sampling, normal inspection)
   - Code Letter H, AQL 1.0 → Sample size **n = 50**, Acceptance number **Ac = 1**, Rejection number **Re = 2**

6. **Interpret**:
   - Inspect 50 parts from lot of 500
   - If ≤1 defective found: **Accept lot** (release entire lot)
   - If ≥2 defective found: **Reject lot** (100% inspect, return to supplier, scrap, or rework)

**Example Sampling Plan**:

| Lot Size | Level | AQL | Code Letter | Sample Size (n) | Accept (Ac) | Reject (Re) |
|----------|-------|-----|-------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| 100 | II | 1.0 | F | 20 | 0 | 1 |
| 500 | II | 1.0 | H | 50 | 1 | 2 |
| 1000 | II | 1.0 | J | 80 | 2 | 3 |
| 100 | II | 2.5 | F | 20 | 1 | 2 |

**Interpretation**:
- Smaller lots → smaller samples, but stricter (Ac often 0)
- Higher AQL → more lenient (higher Ac for same sample size)

### Single vs. Double vs. Multiple Sampling

**Single Sampling** (most common):
- Inspect one sample, make decision (accept or reject)
- Simple to administer

**Double Sampling**:
- Inspect first sample; if results inconclusive, inspect second sample
- May reduce inspection on average (if quality very good or very bad)

**Multiple Sampling**:
- Up to 7 sequential samples
- Complex to administer; rarely used

**Recommendation**: Use **single sampling, normal inspection, Level II** unless specific reason to deviate.

### Sampling Risks

**Producer's Risk (α)**:
- Risk of rejecting good lot (false alarm)
- Standard: α = 5% (when process at AQL, 5% chance lot rejected)

**Consumer's Risk (β)**:
- Risk of accepting bad lot (defects shipped to customer)
- Standard: β = 10% (at Lot Tolerance Percent Defective, LTPD)

**Operating Characteristic (OC) Curve**:
- Graph showing probability of acceptance vs. lot quality
- Steep curve = discriminates well between good and bad lots
- Included in Z1.4 for each sampling plan

## 22.7.7 Gage Calibration and Control

Accurate measurements depend on calibrated gages. Calibration management covered in Section 22.5 (Process Control and Validation), but key points reinforced here.

### Calibration Program Requirements

**ISO 9001 Requirements (Clause 7.1.5.1)**:
- Measuring equipment calibrated or verified at specified intervals
- Calibrated against traceable standards (national or international standards: NIST, PTB, etc.)
- Identified with calibration status (label showing due date)
- Safeguarded from adjustments that would invalidate results
- Protected from damage and deterioration

**Calibration Intervals**:
- Based on: Manufacturer recommendation, stability, usage frequency, criticality
- Common intervals: 6 months, 1 year, 2 years
- Review and adjust based on history (if always in-tolerance, may extend; if out-of-tolerance, shorten)

### Calibration Process

**1. Identify Equipment Requiring Calibration**:
- Micrometers, calipers, indicators, height gages
- CMM, vision systems, profilometers
- Test equipment (torque wrenches, pressure gages, multimeters)
- Environmental monitoring (thermometers, humidity gages)

**2. Master Calibration Schedule**:
- List of all equipment, serial numbers, calibration intervals, due dates
- Updated as equipment calibrated
- Alerts generated before due (2 weeks advance notice typical)

**3. Send for Calibration**:
- **External Lab**: Accredited calibration lab (ISO/IEC 17025)
- **In-House**: If have standards and trained personnel (less common)

**4. Receive Calibration Certificate**:
- Calibration certificate shows:
  - Equipment ID and serial number
  - Date of calibration
  - Standards used (with traceability)
  - "As Found" condition (measurements before adjustment)
  - "As Left" condition (measurements after adjustment/calibration)
  - Pass/fail (in tolerance or out of tolerance)
  - Uncertainty of measurement
  - Calibration lab accreditation (ISO/IEC 17025 logo)
  - Next calibration due date

**5. Affix Calibration Label**:
- Sticker on gage showing:
  - Calibration date
  - Due date (or month/year due)
  - Calibration lab or ID
- Green/Yellow/Red labels (green = current, yellow = due soon, red = overdue)

**6. Return to Service**:
- If passed calibration, return to use
- Update calibration schedule
- File calibration certificate

**7. Out-of-Tolerance Action**:
- If gage found out-of-tolerance at calibration:
  - Investigate impact (what was measured since last calibration?)
  - Notify affected customers if parts shipped (may need recall or re-inspection)
  - Adjust or repair gage
  - Re-calibrate

**8. Overdue Action**:
- If gage used past due date:
  - Remove from service immediately
  - Quarantine (tag "OUT OF CALIBRATION - DO NOT USE")
  - Send for calibration
  - Investigate impact (measurements since due date are suspect)
  - Preventive action (improve alert system, training)

### Gage Management Best Practices

**Gage Inventory**:
- Assign unique ID to each gage (engraved or labeled)
- Maintain database (gage type, serial number, location, calibration due date, history)

**User Training**:
- Train personnel on proper use of gages
- Handling, storage, maintenance
- Recognize calibration status (check label before use)

**Gage Storage**:
- Protective cases
- Climate-controlled storage (precision gages sensitive to temperature, humidity)
- Clean and dry environment

**Gage R&R** (Measurement Systems Analysis):
- Periodically verify gage repeatability and reproducibility
- Covered in Section 22.14 (MSA)

## Summary

Inspection and testing are the final gatekeepers ensuring only conforming products reach customers. Effective inspection starts with understanding drawing requirements, uses strategic in-process checks to catch problems early, and concludes with thorough final inspection before release. First Article Inspection validates new processes. Statistical sampling plans (ANSI/ASQ Z1.4) balance inspection cost with risk. Inspection records provide traceability and evidence of conformance. Calibrated gages ensure measurement accuracy.

A robust inspection program, combined with capable processes (high Cpk), provides confidence that products consistently meet requirements.

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Create Inspection Plan from Drawing

Obtain or create a simple engineering drawing:
1. Identify all dimensions and requirements to inspect
2. Number characteristics sequentially (1, 2, 3...)
3. Classify each characteristic (critical, major, minor)
4. For each characteristic, specify:
   - Inspection method (gage/tool)
   - Inspection frequency (first-off, in-process, final)
   - Sample size (100%, sample)
5. Create inspection checklist or form

### Exercise 2: Design In-Process Inspection Strategy

For a multi-operation machined part:
1. List all operations (Op 1, 2, 3...)
2. Identify strategic in-process inspection points
3. For each inspection point, justify why (catches critical dimension, before expensive operation, etc.)
4. Specify what to inspect at each point
5. Design traveler section for recording in-process inspection results

### Exercise 3: Sampling Plan Determination

Using ANSI/ASQ Z1.4 (tables available online or in standard):
1. Determine sampling plans for following scenarios:
   - Lot size 150, Level II, AQL 1.0
   - Lot size 800, Level II, AQL 2.5
   - Lot size 50, Level II, AQL 0.65
2. For each, specify:
   - Sample size code letter
   - Sample size (n)
   - Acceptance number (Ac)
   - Rejection number (Re)
3. Interpret: "Inspect ___ parts; accept lot if ≤___ defective; reject if ≥___ defective"

### Exercise 4: Final Inspection Report

Create a final inspection report template:
1. Design form layout (headers, fields, tables)
2. Include all required information (part ID, drawing, date, inspector, etc.)
3. Section for dimensional results (characteristic, requirement, result, pass/fail)
4. Section for visual inspection
5. Section for documentation review (traveler, certs)
6. Acceptance decision and signature
7. Fill in sample data for hypothetical part

### Exercise 5: Calibration Schedule

Create a calibration schedule for inspection department:
1. List 10 pieces of measurement equipment (micrometers, calipers, CMM, etc.)
2. Assign unique ID numbers
3. Determine calibration interval for each (6 months, 1 year, 2 years)
4. Create schedule table (ID, description, serial number, interval, last cal date, next due date)
5. Determine which gages due for calibration this month
