# Module 21 – Metrology and Precision Measurement


## 21.4.1 Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMM)

The Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) is the cornerstone of modern precision inspection, capable of measuring complex 3D geometries with micron-level accuracy.

### 21.4.1.1 CMM Types and Configurations

**Bridge CMM** (Most Common):
- Fixed table with moving bridge
- Three linear axes (X, Y, Z)
- High accuracy and rigidity
- Sizes from 500mm to several meters
- Typical accuracy: 1.5-3.0 μm + L/300

**Gantry CMM**:
- Open structure with moving table
- Suitable for large, heavy parts
- Used in automotive and aerospace
- Ground-level loading

**Cantilever CMM**:
- L-shaped structure
- Easy access for loading
- Less rigid than bridge type
- Good for small to medium parts

**Horizontal Arm CMM**:
- Horizontal probe orientation
- Ideal for large automotive body panels
- Easy part access

**Portable/Articulated Arm CMM**:
- Handheld articulated arm
- Brought to part instead of part to CMM
- Lower accuracy but highly flexible
- Useful for large assemblies or field measurement

**Vision CMM**:
- Optical/video-based measurement
- Non-contact, ideal for soft parts
- Limited to 2D or surface features

### CMM Accuracy Specifications

**Volumetric Accuracy**:

Typically expressed as: **E = A + L/K**

Where:
- E = Maximum permissible error
- A = Constant error (instrument accuracy)
- L = Measured length
- K = Constant (typically 200-400)

Example: 1.5 μm + L/300 means:
- 100mm measurement: ±1.8 μm
- 500mm measurement: ±3.2 μm

**Repeatability**: Typically 1/3 to 1/2 of accuracy specification

### 21.4.1.2 Probe Systems (Touch, Scanning, Optical)

**Touch Trigger Probes**:

- Most common CMM probe type
- Makes point contact with part
- Sends signal when probe deflects threshold amount
- Single points are measured and processed

**Advantages**:

- Captures thousands of points per second
- Creates dense point clouds

**Types**:
- **Analog scanning**: Measures probe deflection continuously
- **Passive scanning**: Part moves through stationary probe
- **Active scanning**: Probe actively follows surface

**Advantages**:

- Excellent for freeform surfaces
- High point density

**Disadvantages**:
- More expensive
- Requires sophisticated software
- More complex programming

**Optical/Laser Probes**:

- Non-contact measurement

- Extremely fast data capture
- Can measure complex organic shapes

**Disadvantages**:
- Surface finish affects accuracy
- Reflective or transparent surfaces problematic
- Less accurate than touch probes

**Probe Changing Systems**:

### 21.4.1.3 CMM Programming and Operation

**Manual CMM Operation**:

- Operator guides probe using joystick
- Software prompts for feature type
- Useful for one-off inspections
- Teaches basics of CMM measurement

**DCC (Direct Computer Control)**:

- CMM follows programmed path automatically
- Most efficient for production inspection
- Consistent and repeatable
- Requires programming time investment

**Programming Methods**:

1. **Teach Mode**: Manually guide probe, record positions
2. **CAD Programming**: Import CAD model, select features to measure
3. **Offline Programming**: Program without using CMM (based on CAD)

**Measurement Strategy**:

**Datum Establishment**:
1. Measure primary datum feature first (typically a plane)
2. Measure secondary datum (perpendicular plane or axis)
3. Measure tertiary datum (complete constraint)

**Feature Measurement**:
- Planes: Minimum 3 points (more for large or irregular surfaces)
- Circles: Minimum 4 points (8-12 typical for accuracy)
- Cylinders: Multiple circles at different heights
- Spheres: Minimum 4 points (more for better accuracy)

**Probe Qualification** (Probe Calibration):

Before measurement, probe tip must be calibrated:
1. Measure reference sphere at multiple orientations
2. Software calculates effective probe tip diameter
3. Compensates for probe deflection and stylus geometry
4. Required after probe change or crash

**Environmental Control**:

- CMMs require stable temperature (20°C ± 1°C)
- Vibration isolation (isolated foundation)
- Clean environment (dust affects accuracy)
- Part soaking time: 1 hour per inch of thickness

**Best Practices**:

- Clean part before measurement (oil, chips, dirt affect results)
- Use minimum probing force for delicate parts
- Measure critical features multiple times
- Document measurement uncertainty
- Regular CMM calibration using certified standards

## 21.4.2 Laser Interferometry

Laser interferometers are the most accurate method for measuring linear displacement and are used to calibrate machine tools and CMMs.

### Principle of Operation

**Interference of Light Waves**:

- Laser beam split into reference and measurement beams
- Measurement beam reflects off moving target
- Beams recombine creating interference fringes
- Each fringe represents λ/2 displacement (typically ~316nm for HeNe laser)
- Electronic counting of fringes gives displacement

**Accuracy**: 0.1 ppm (parts per million) of reading

Example: Over 1 meter, accuracy is ±0.1 μm

### Applications

**Machine Tool Calibration**:
- Measures linear positioning accuracy
- Identifies systematic errors
- Creates error compensation maps

**CMM Calibration**:

- Linear stage verification

**Length Measurement**:
- Precision length standards
- Gage block calibration

### Environmental Corrections

Laser wavelength depends on air conditions:

**Corrections Applied**:
- Temperature
- Pressure
- Humidity
- CO₂ content

Modern systems measure environmental parameters and automatically compensate.
