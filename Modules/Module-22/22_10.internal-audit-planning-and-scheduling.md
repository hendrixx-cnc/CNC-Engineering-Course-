# Module 22 – Quality Management Systems (QMS)


Internal audits and management reviews are essential mechanisms for monitoring QMS effectiveness, ensuring compliance, and driving continuous improvement. This section covers audit planning, execution, reporting, and management review processes.

---

## 22.10.1 Internal Audit Planning and Scheduling

**Internal Audit**: Systematic, independent examination of the QMS to determine if activities and results comply with requirements and are effectively implemented.

### Purpose of Internal Audits

**Compliance Verification**:
- Verify conformance to ISO 9001 (or AS9100, ISO 13485, IATF 16949)
- Check adherence to company procedures
- Meet regulatory requirements

**Effectiveness Assessment**:
- Determine if QMS achieving intended results
- Identify opportunities for improvement
- Verify corrective actions effective

**Preparation for External Audits**:
- Practice for certification audits
- Identify and fix issues before external auditors find them
- Build confidence in QMS

**Continuous Improvement**:
- Identify best practices to share across organization
- Drive process improvements
- Foster quality culture

### Annual Audit Schedule

**ISO 9001 Requirement**: Conduct internal audits at planned intervals

**Best Practice**: Audit all QMS processes at least annually

**Audit Schedule Development**:

**1. Identify Processes to Audit**:
- All processes in scope of QMS (operations, support, management)
- Each ISO 9001 clause (4-10)

**2. Determine Audit Frequency**:
- **Annual minimum** for all processes
- **More frequent** for:
  - Critical processes (affect safety, regulatory compliance)
  - Processes with poor performance (high defect rate, customer complaints)
  - Recently changed processes (new equipment, revised procedures)
  - External audit findings or customer concerns
- **Less frequent** for:
  - Mature, stable processes with excellent performance
  - Low-risk areas

**3. Create Schedule**:
- Distribute audits throughout year (avoid all audits at year-end)
- Consider operational factors (avoid auditing during busy season if possible)
- Assign auditors

**Example Annual Audit Schedule**:

| Month | Process/Area to Audit | ISO 9001 Clauses | Auditor | Status |
|-------|----------------------|------------------|---------|--------|
| Jan | Document Control | 7.5 | Q. Manager | Complete |
| Feb | Training and Competence | 7.2 | HR Manager | Complete |
| Mar | CNC Machining Operations | 8.5 | Eng Manager | Scheduled |
| Apr | Supplier Management | 8.4 | Purchasing | |
| May | Inspection and Testing | 8.6, 7.1.5 | QA Lead | |
| Jun | Calibration | 7.1.5 | QA Lead | |
| Jul | Nonconforming Product | 8.7 | Q. Manager | |
| Aug | Internal Audits | 9.2 | Eng Manager | |
| Sep | Management Review | 9.3 | QA Lead | |
| Oct | Preventive Maintenance | 7.1.3 | Maint Manager | |
| Nov | Customer Communication | 8.2.1 | Sales Manager | |
| Dec | Corrective Action | 10.2 | Q. Manager | |

**Schedule Approval**: Quality Manager approves annual schedule; communicated to all departments

**Schedule Flexibility**: Adjust as needed (add audits for problems, reschedule for conflicts)

## 22.10.2 Auditor Qualification and Training

### Auditor Qualifications

**Effective Auditors Need**:

**Knowledge**:
- ISO 9001 requirements (thorough understanding)
- Industry-specific standards (AS9100, ISO 13485, IATF 16949 if applicable)
- Company procedures and processes
- Audit techniques and methodologies

**Skills**:
- Interviewing and questioning (open-ended questions, active listening)
- Observation (see what's happening, not just what's documented)
- Objective evidence gathering (verify with records, samples)
- Analysis and evaluation (identify root causes, systemic issues)
- Communication (written reports, oral presentation)

**Personal Attributes**:
- Objectivity and impartiality (no bias)
- Integrity and ethics
- Diplomacy and tact (constructive, not adversarial)
- Persistence and thoroughness
- Open-mindedness

### Auditor Independence

**ISO 9001 Requirement**: Auditors must be **independent** and **impartial**

**Independence**:
- **Cannot audit own work** (conflict of interest)
- Example: Production Manager cannot audit production operations they manage
- Can audit other departments (Production Manager can audit Inspection Department)

**Small Organizations**:
- Limited personnel may make full independence difficult
- Options:
  - Use auditors from different shifts or locations
  - Hire external auditors (consultants)
  - Partner with similar companies (exchange auditors)

### Auditor Training

**Internal Auditor Training**:

**Formal Training Course** (recommended):
- ISO 9001 Internal Auditor course (2-3 days)
- Covers:
  - ISO 9001 requirements (clause-by-clause)
  - Audit process (planning, execution, reporting)
  - Audit techniques (questioning, sampling, evidence)
  - Practice audits (role-play, case studies)
- Certificate of completion

**On-the-Job Training**:
- Shadow experienced auditor (observe audit)
- Co-audit (participate as trainee auditor)
- Gradual progression (audit simple processes first, complex later)

**Ongoing Development**:
- Attend refresher training (when ISO 9001 revised)
- Participate in auditor meetings (share experiences, lessons learned)
- Review audit findings and reports (learn from others)

**Auditor Qualification Records**:
- Training certificates
- Education and experience
- Audit participation log (audits conducted)

---

## 22.10.3 Audit Preparation and Checklists

### Audit Planning

**Audit Notification**:
- Notify auditee 1-2 weeks in advance
- Provide audit plan (scope, date, time, auditor)
- Request documents for review (procedures, records)

**Document Review**:
- Review procedures and work instructions for process being audited
- Review previous audit reports (findings, corrective actions)
- Review performance data (metrics, NCRs, customer complaints)

**Audit Checklist Development**:
- List requirements to audit (ISO 9001 clauses, procedures)
- Prepare questions to ask
- Identify records to review

### Audit Checklist

**Checklist Purpose**:
- Ensure comprehensive audit (don't miss requirements)
- Provide structure (guide auditor through process)
- Document findings (notes on checklist)

**Checklist Format**:

## 22.10.4 Conducting Effective Audits

### 22.10.4.1 Opening Meeting

**Purpose**: Introduce audit team, confirm scope, explain process

**Attendees**: Auditor(s), auditee (supervisor/manager), other key personnel

**Agenda** (5-10 minutes):
1. **Introductions**: Auditor and auditees introduce themselves
2. **Audit Scope**: Confirm process/area being audited
3. **Audit Criteria**: ISO 9001 clauses, procedures applicable
4. **Audit Schedule**: Timing, locations, who will be interviewed
5. **Audit Process**: Explain how audit conducted (interviews, observations, record review)
6. **Confidentiality**: Findings discussed in closing meeting, report issued later
7. **Questions**: Auditee may ask questions

**Tone**: Professional, collaborative (not adversarial)

### 22.10.4.2 Evidence Collection and Sampling

**Objective Evidence**: Factual information verifiable through observation, measurement, test, or examination of records

**Sources of Objective Evidence**:
- **Interviews**: Ask personnel how they perform tasks
- **Observations**: Watch activities being performed
- **Records**: Review documents (inspection reports, training records, calibration certs)
- **Physical Examination**: Inspect parts, equipment, gages

**Audit Trail** (follow process flow):
- Start at beginning of process, follow through to end
- Example: Machining audit trail:
  - Order received → Job planning → Program → Setup → First-off inspection → Production → In-process checks → Final inspection → Shipping

**Sampling**:
- Cannot audit everything (time constraint)
- Select representative samples
- **Sampling Guidelines**:
  - Review 3-5 records of each type (training records, NCRs, calibration certs)
  - Interview 2-3 people performing same task
  - Observe at least one example of each critical activity
- **Risk-based sampling**: More samples for critical or problem areas

**Audit Techniques**:

**Effective Questioning**:
- **Open-ended questions**: "How do you verify the setup is correct?" (encourages detailed answer)
- **Avoid leading questions**: "You do verify setups, right?" (leads to yes/no)
- **Follow-up**: "Can you show me?" "Where is that documented?"

**Active Listening**:
- Pay attention to answers
- Take notes
- Observe body language and environment

**Verification**:
- Don't just ask, verify with evidence
- "You said you calibrate gages annually. Can you show me calibration records for this micrometer?"

**Examples of Evidence Collection**:

**Requirement**: Operators trained on work instructions

**Audit Steps**:
1. **Interview operator**: "How did you learn to perform this operation?"
2. **Observe**: Watch operator perform task; compare to work instruction
3. **Review records**: Check training record for operator signature and date
4. **Conclusion**: If training record exists, operator demonstrates competence, and follows work instruction → **Conformance**. If training record missing or operator doesn't follow procedure → **Nonconformance**.

### 22.10.4.3 Finding Classification

**Finding Types**:

**1. Conformance**:
- Requirement met
- Evidence supports compliance
- Document positive findings (recognize good practices)

**2. Nonconformance**:
- Requirement not met
- Evidence shows failure to comply
- Classified as Major or Minor

**3. Observation** (Opportunity for Improvement):
- Not yet a nonconformance, but potential risk
- Best practice not followed
- Trend indicating future problem

**Major vs. Minor Nonconformance**:

**Major Nonconformance**:
- Significant failure to meet requirement
- Systemic issue (affects multiple areas or frequent occurrence)
- Absence of required system (no calibration program, no document control)
- Could affect product quality, safety, or regulatory compliance

**Examples**:
- "Five of ten gages inspected have no calibration records. ISO 9001 Clause 7.1.5.1 requires calibration at specified intervals."
- "No procedure exists for document control. ISO 9001 Clause 7.5.3 requires documented information be controlled."

**Minor Nonconformance**:
- Isolated lapse or single occurrence
- Does not systemic or critical
- Documentation issue (record incomplete, procedure missing detail)

**Examples**:
- "Training record for Operator X dated 15-Jan-2024 missing supervisor signature. Procedure QP-05 requires supervisor approval."
- "Procedure QP-10 Calibration Control does not specify retention period for calibration records. ISO 9001 Clause 7.5.3 requires retention period be determined."

**Observation**:
- Potential for improvement, not yet nonconformance

**Examples**:
- "Gages stored in open toolbox on shop floor exposed to chips and coolant. Consider enclosed storage to prevent damage and extend gage life."
- "Scrap rate has increased from 1% to 2.5% over past 3 months (still within target of <3%, but trending unfavorably). Recommend investigation."

**Finding Documentation**:
- Write findings clearly and specifically
- Include objective evidence (what was observed, records reviewed, who interviewed)
- Cite requirement (ISO 9001 clause, procedure number)
- Avoid ambiguous language

**Good Finding** (clear, specific):
> "Work instruction WI-105 for CMM operation, Rev B dated 10-Jan-2023, is posted at CMM workstation. Current revision per document control log is Rev C dated 05-Feb-2024 (supersedes Rev B). ISO 9001 Clause 7.5.3.2 requires current revisions be available at point of use. **Minor Nonconformance.**"

**Poor Finding** (vague):
> "Documents not current." (Unclear: which documents? how verified? what requirement?)

### 22.10.4.4 Closing Meeting

**Purpose**: Present findings, discuss corrective actions, close audit

**Attendees**: Auditor(s), auditee (supervisor/manager), other key personnel

**Agenda** (15-30 minutes):
1. **Thank Auditee**: Acknowledge cooperation and time
2. **Summarize Audit**: Overview of areas audited
3. **Present Conformances**: Highlight positive findings (good practices, improvements since last audit)
4. **Present Nonconformances**: Describe each nonconformance (major, minor)
   - Read finding
   - Show evidence (if applicable)
   - Allow auditee to clarify or provide additional information
5. **Present Observations**: Improvement opportunities
6. **Discuss Next Steps**: Corrective action required, timelines, follow-up
7. **Questions**: Auditee may ask questions or request clarification

**Tone**: Constructive, collaborative
- Focus on systems, not people ("The process lacks..." not "You didn't...")
- Findings are opportunities for improvement, not personal criticism

**Auditee Response**:
- Auditee may agree with finding
- Auditee may provide additional information that changes finding (if evidence provided, auditor may revise finding)
- Auditee may disagree (auditor notes disagreement in report, but finding stands unless evidence contradicts)

### 22.10.6.2 Review Outputs

**ISO 9001 Required Outputs**: Decisions and actions related to:

**1. Opportunities for Improvement**:
- Process improvements identified (reduce cycle time, improve Cpk)
- Efficiency gains (Lean projects, automation)

**2. Changes to QMS**:
- Procedure updates required
- New processes to implement (AS9100 certification)
- Documentation revisions

**3. Resource Needs**:
- Personnel (hiring, training)
- Equipment (new machines, gages, software)
- Infrastructure (facility expansion, climate control)

**Example Management Review Outputs**:

| Decision/Action | Responsible | Due Date | Status |
|-----------------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Approve CMM programmer hire (budget $75k) | VP Operations | 30-Jul-2024 | Open |
| Initiate AS9100 certification project | Quality Manager | 31-Dec-2024 | Open |
| Implement cross-training program for machinists | Production Manager | 30-Sep-2024 | Open |
| Investigate MES system (quote and ROI analysis) | Engineering Manager | 31-Aug-2024 | Open |
| Audit suppliers on probation within 30 days | Purchasing | 15-Jul-2024 | Open |
| Revise on-time delivery improvement plan | Operations Manager | 30-Jun-2024 | Open |

### Management Review Frequency

**ISO 9001**: "At planned intervals" (no specific frequency)

**Best Practice**: **Semi-annually** (twice per year) or **quarterly** (four times per year)

**Considerations**:
- Larger organizations, complex QMS: Quarterly
- Smaller organizations, stable QMS: Semi-annually
- External audit schedule: Review before certification audit

### Management Review Documentation

**Management Review Minutes**:
- Document meeting (date, attendees, agenda)
- Summarize inputs presented
- Record decisions and actions (outputs)
- Assign responsibilities and due dates
- Signatures (Quality Manager, Top Management)

**Retention**: Maintain minutes as QMS records (typically 3-10 years)

## Summary

Internal audits and management reviews are vital QMS monitoring and improvement mechanisms. Internal audits verify compliance, identify improvement opportunities, and prepare for external audits. Effective audits require qualified auditors, thorough planning, objective evidence collection, and clear findings. Management reviews provide top management's systematic evaluation of QMS performance, enabling data-driven decisions on improvements, changes, and resource allocation.

Together, internal audits and management reviews ensure the QMS remains effective, aligned with business strategy, and continuously improving.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Internal audits** verify QMS compliance and effectiveness; required at least annually for all processes
2. **Audit schedule** should cover all QMS processes; high-risk areas audited more frequently
3. **Auditor independence** critical; cannot audit own work
4. **Auditor qualifications** include ISO 9001 knowledge, audit skills, and personal attributes (objectivity, integrity)
5. **Audit preparation** includes document review and checklist development
6. **Audit process**: Opening meeting → Evidence collection → Findings → Closing meeting → Report → Follow-up
7. **Objective evidence** gathered through interviews, observations, record review, physical examination
8. **Findings classified**: Conformances, nonconformances (major/minor), observations
9. **Audit report** documents findings, requires corrective action for nonconformances
10. **Management review** conducted at planned intervals (semi-annually or quarterly typical)
11. **Management review inputs**: Previous actions, context changes, QMS performance, audits, customer satisfaction, supplier performance, resources, risks
12. **Management review outputs**: Decisions on improvements, QMS changes, resource needs

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Develop Audit Schedule

Create an annual internal audit schedule:
1. List all processes/areas in your QMS (or hypothetical shop)
2. Map to ISO 9001 clauses
3. Determine audit frequency (annually, semi-annually, quarterly)
4. Assign months to distribute audits throughout year
5. Assign auditors (ensure independence)
6. Create schedule table

### Exercise 2: Create Audit Checklist

Develop audit checklist for a process:
1. Select process (document control, calibration, inspection, machining operations)
2. Identify applicable ISO 9001 clauses
3. List requirements to verify
4. Write open-ended questions to ask
5. Identify records to review
6. Format as checklist with space for notes

### Exercise 3: Classify Audit Findings

For each scenario, classify as conformance, major nonconformance, minor nonconformance, or observation:
1. Ten gages inspected; all have current calibration stickers and certificates on file
2. Three of eight training records reviewed are missing supervisor signature
3. No procedure exists for controlling nonconforming product
4. Work instruction at machining station is current revision, but torn and difficult to read
5. Scrap rate increased from 1.5% to 2.8% in past 3 months (target <3%, but trending poorly)

### Exercise 4: Write Audit Findings

Draft audit findings for nonconformances:
1. Select scenario (missing calibration, incomplete training record, obsolete document in use)
2. Write finding including:
   - Description of nonconformance (what was wrong?)
   - Objective evidence (how verified?)
   - Requirement cited (ISO 9001 clause, procedure)
   - Classification (major or minor)
3. Make finding clear, specific, factual

### Exercise 5: Prepare Management Review Agenda

Create management review agenda for your organization:
1. List all required inputs per ISO 9001
2. Add any additional inputs relevant to your business
3. Assign time for each agenda item
4. Identify who will present each topic
5. Schedule meeting (date, time, attendees)
