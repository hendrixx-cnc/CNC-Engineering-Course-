# Module 7 – Fiber Laser

## 1. Introduction: Fiber Laser Cutting Technology and Applications

### 1.1 The Fiber Laser Revolution in Metal Fabrication

Fiber laser cutting has transformed sheet metal fabrication since commercial introduction in 2005, displacing CO₂ lasers in 70% of new installations by 2020 through superior performance in three critical metrics: (1) **wavelength absorption**—1.06 μm fiber laser light absorbs 8-12× better in reflective metals (aluminum, copper, brass) than 10.6 μm CO₂ light, enabling efficient cutting of materials previously requiring plasma or waterjet, (2) **electrical efficiency**—fiber lasers convert 25-40% of wall-plug power to beam output versus 8-12% for CO₂, reducing operating cost by $3-8 per hour for equivalent 6 kW cutting power, and (3) **maintenance requirements**—solid-state fiber lasers operate 30,000-50,000 hours between interventions compared to 2,000-5,000 hours for CO₂ laser optics and gas fill, eliminating $15,000-25,000 annual service costs for production systems. These advantages drive rapid adoption across industries from automotive stamping (body panels, brackets, exhaust components) to aerospace fabrication (aluminum bulkheads, titanium fittings), HVAC ductwork, electronics enclosures, and medical device manufacturing.

**Market Performance Metrics (2024 Industry Data):**
- Fiber laser installations: 65% of global laser cutting market share (up from 15% in 2010)
- Power range: 1-30 kW commercial systems (6-12 kW represents 55% of installations)
- Cutting capacity: 0.5-30 mm steel, 0.5-25 mm stainless, 0.5-20 mm aluminum
- Typical ROI: 18-36 months for production environment (two-shift operation)
- Price range: $75,000-150,000 for 3-6 kW flying optics system; $250,000-500,000 for 12-20 kW with automation

### 1.2 Physical Principles: Why Fiber Lasers Excel at Metal Cutting

**Wavelength and Absorption:**

The fundamental advantage of fiber lasers stems from wavelength-dependent absorption in metals. Absorption coefficient α (fraction of incident light absorbed) follows Drude model for metals:

$$\alpha(\lambda) \propto \frac{1}{\lambda}$$

For most metals, absorption increases inversely with wavelength, making shorter wavelengths more efficient:

| Material | CO₂ Absorption (10.6 μm) | Fiber Laser Absorption (1.06 μm) | Absorption Ratio |
|----------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------|
| **Mild steel** | 4-8% | 30-40% | 5-10× improvement |
| **Stainless steel 304** | 5-10% | 35-45% | 4-7× improvement |
| **Aluminum 6061** | 2-4% | 15-25% | 6-10× improvement |
| **Copper** | 1-2% | 8-15% | 8-12× improvement |
| **Brass (70/30)** | 2-5% | 12-20% | 5-8× improvement |

This wavelength advantage enables fiber lasers to efficiently cut reflective materials (aluminum, copper) that bounce 95-98% of CO₂ laser light, requiring 3-5× more CO₂ power to achieve equivalent cutting speed.

**Beam Quality and Focus:**

Fiber lasers deliver near-diffraction-limited beam quality with M² = 1.05-1.3 (M² = 1.0 represents perfect Gaussian beam). This enables focus to extremely small spot diameters:

$$d_{spot} = \frac{4 \lambda f M^2}{\pi D}$$

where:
- $d_{spot}$ = focused spot diameter (μm)
- $λ$ = wavelength (1.06 μm for fiber laser, 10.6 μm for CO₂)
- $f$ = focal length (mm)
- $M^2$ = beam quality factor
- $D$ = collimated beam diameter (mm)

For identical optical configuration ($f = 150$ mm, $D = 30$ mm, $M^2 = 1.2$):
- Fiber laser spot: $d_{spot} = (4 \times 1.06 \times 150 \times 1.2) / (\pi \times 30) = 8.1$ μm
- CO₂ laser spot: $d_{spot} = (4 \times 10.6 \times 150 \times 1.2) / (\pi \times 30) = 81$ μm

**Power density** (W/mm²) scales inversely with spot area:

$$I = \frac{4P}{\pi d_{spot}^2}$$

For equivalent 3 kW power:
- Fiber laser: $I = (4 \times 3000) / (\pi \times 0.0081^2) = 58.3$ MW/mm²
- CO₂ laser: $I = (4 \times 3000) / (\pi \times 0.081^2) = 583$ kW/mm²

Fiber laser achieves **100× higher power density** at equivalent beam power, enabling faster piercing, narrower kerf width (0.1-0.3 mm vs. 0.3-0.5 mm for CO₂), and cleaner edge quality on thin materials (<3 mm).

### 1.3 Comparative Technology Analysis

**Fiber Laser vs. CO₂ Laser:**

| Criterion | Fiber Laser | CO₂ Laser | Advantage |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Wavelength** | 1.06 μm | 10.6 μm | Fiber (10× absorption in metals) |
| **Electrical efficiency** | 25-40% | 8-12% | Fiber (3× lower operating cost) |
| **Beam delivery** | Flexible fiber optic cable | Articulated mirror arm | Fiber (simplified motion design) |
| **Maintenance interval** | 30,000-50,000 hours | 2,000-5,000 hours | Fiber (15× longer service life) |
| **Maintenance cost (annual)** | $2,000-5,000 | $15,000-25,000 | Fiber (5× lower cost) |
| **Reflective material cutting** | Excellent | Difficult/dangerous | Fiber (back-reflection safe) |
| **Thick steel (>20 mm)** | Good | Excellent | CO₂ (mature process, lower $ per watt at high power) |
| **Non-metallic materials** | Poor (absorbed by plastics/wood) | Excellent | CO₂ (versatile for acrylic, wood, fabric) |

**Fiber Laser vs. Plasma Cutting:**

Plasma offers lower capital cost ($30,000-80,000 vs. $75,000-150,000 for equivalent cutting capacity) but produces wider kerf (2-5 mm vs. 0.2-0.4 mm), larger heat-affected zone (HAZ of 1-3 mm vs. 0.1-0.5 mm), and rougher edge finish (Ra 15-40 μm vs. 3-10 μm). Fiber laser provides:
- **Precision:** ±0.1 mm tolerance capability vs. ±0.5 mm for plasma
- **Edge quality:** ISO 9013 quality grade 1-3 vs. grade 4-5 for plasma
- **No secondary processing:** 80% of fiber laser parts ship as-cut vs. 30% for plasma (grinding/deburring required)
- **Finer features:** 1:1 hole diameter to thickness ratio (1 mm hole in 1 mm plate) vs. 1.5:1 for plasma

**Trade-off:** Plasma remains cost-effective for thick plate (>25 mm) structural steel where edge finish is non-critical, and for portable cutting applications (plasma torches $5,000-15,000 vs. fiber laser requiring stationary installation).

### 1.4 Applications and Material Capabilities

**Cutting Capacity by Material (6 kW Fiber Laser Baseline):**

| Material | Maximum Thickness (Oxygen) | Maximum Thickness (Nitrogen) | Typical Speed @ 3 mm |
|----------|----------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Mild steel (A36, 1020)** | 25 mm | 15 mm | 8-12 m/min |
| **Stainless steel (304, 316)** | 20 mm | 12 mm | 5-8 m/min |
| **Aluminum (5052, 6061)** | N/A | 12 mm | 6-10 m/min |
| **Galvanized steel** | 20 mm | 10 mm | 6-9 m/min |
| **Titanium (Grade 2, Ti-6Al-4V)** | N/A | 8 mm | 2-4 m/min |
| **Copper (110, 122)** | N/A | 6 mm | 3-5 m/min |
| **Brass (260, 360)** | N/A | 10 mm | 4-7 m/min |

**Power scaling:** 12 kW fiber laser increases thick material capacity to 30-35 mm mild steel (oxygen), 25 mm stainless (nitrogen), 20 mm aluminum. Thin material (<5 mm) cutting speed increases 40-60% from 6 kW to 12 kW.
