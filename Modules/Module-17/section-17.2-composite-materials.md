# 17.2 Composite Materials Science

## Definition and Structure

**Composite Material**: A macroscopic combination of two or more distinct materials with a recognizable interface between them, engineered to achieve superior properties compared to individual constituents.

**Three Essential Components**:
1. **Reinforcement**: Load-bearing phase (fibers, particles, whiskers)
2. **Matrix**: Continuous phase binding reinforcement
3. **Interface**: Critical bond zone transferring stress between phases

## Composite Architectures

### Fiber Orientations

**Unidirectional (UD)**:
- All fibers aligned in single direction
- Maximum strength and stiffness along fiber axis
- Weak in transverse direction (matrix-dominated)
- Typical properties (carbon/epoxy):
  - Longitudinal tensile: 2,000 MPa
  - Transverse tensile: 50 MPa (40× weaker!)
  - Longitudinal modulus: 140 GPa
  - Transverse modulus: 10 GPa

**Woven Fabric**:
- Fibers interlaced in warp and fill directions
- Balanced properties in two directions
- Easier to handle than UD tape
- Slight crimping reduces properties (10-20% vs UD)
- Plain weave, twill, satin weaves

**Braided**:
- Fibers interlaced at ±θ° to axis
- Complex 3D shapes (tubes, I-beams)
- Good impact resistance
- Automated production

**Random Mat**:
- Short chopped fibers randomly oriented
- Isotropic in-plane properties
- Lower strength (30% of UD)
- Low cost, ease of manufacturing
- Non-structural applications

### Layup Design

**Quasi-Isotropic Layup**:
- [0/±45/90]ₛ - balanced properties in all directions
- Subscript 's' indicates symmetric layup
- Prevents warping during cure
- General-purpose structural applications

**Angle-Ply Layup**:
- [±θ]ₙ - optimized for specific load direction
- [±45] for shear loading
- [0/90] for orthogonal loading
- 'n' indicates number of repeating units

**Laminate Theory**:

Classical Laminated Plate Theory (CLPT) predicts composite behavior:

**Stiffness Matrix [ABD]**:
- [A]: Extensional stiffness
- [B]: Bending-extension coupling
- [D]: Bending stiffness

For symmetric laminates, [B] = 0 (no coupling - desirable).

**Example Calculation**:

For a [0/90/0] carbon/epoxy laminate with ply thickness t = 0.125 mm:

Properties of single UD ply:
- E₁ = 140 GPa (longitudinal)
- E₂ = 10 GPa (transverse)
- G₁₂ = 5 GPa (shear)
- ν₁₂ = 0.3 (Poisson's ratio)

Transformed reduced stiffness matrix [Q̄] for each ply, then:

$$A_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \bar{Q}_{ij}^{(k)} (z_{k} - z_{k-1})$$

Results in laminate modulus ≈ 75 GPa (halfway between E₁ and E₂).

### Sandwich Structures

**Configuration**:
- Two thin, stiff face sheets (composite)
- Lightweight core separating faces
- Core resists shear, faces resist bending

**Bending Stiffness**:

For sandwich beam with face thickness $t_f$, core thickness $c$, face modulus $E_f$, width $b$:

$$D = \frac{E_f b t_f (c + t_f)^2}{2}$$

Example:
- 1 mm carbon faces, 10 mm foam core, 100 mm wide
- $E_f$ = 70 GPa (woven carbon)
- $D$ = $\frac{70 \times 10^9 \times 0.1 \times 0.001 \times 0.011^2}{2}$ = 421 N·m²

Solid plate of same weight (2.2 mm carbon): $D$ = 26 N·m² (16× less stiff!)

**Core Materials**:

| Core Type | Density (kg/m³) | Shear Strength (MPa) | Shear Modulus (MPa) | Cost ($/m²) |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| PVC Foam (Divinycell H80) | 80 | 1.4 | 30 | $30-50 |
| PMI Foam (Rohacell 110) | 110 | 2.5 | 54 | $100-200 |
| Aluminum Honeycomb (1/8" cell) | 80 | 1.7 | 280 | $50-100 |
| Nomex Honeycomb (1/8" cell) | 48 | 1.2 | 140 | $80-150 |
| Balsa Wood (end grain) | 150 | 2.0 | 200 | $20-40 |

**Machining Considerations**:
- Core easily damaged (crushing, heat)
- Edge routing requires sharp tools, high speed
- Dust collection critical (foam dust hazardous)
- Potential for face/core debonding

## Manufacturing Processes

### Hand Layup

**Process**:
1. Mold preparation and release agent
2. Gel coat application (if needed)
3. Resin application to mold
4. Fabric placement
5. Consolidation (roller, brush)
6. Cure at room temperature or elevated temperature

**Advantages**:
- Low tooling cost
- Flexible for prototypes
- Large structures possible

**Disadvantages**:
- Labor intensive
- Variable quality
- Health hazards (styrene exposure)
- Fiber volume fraction: 30-50%

### Vacuum Bagging

**Process Enhancement to Hand Layup**:
- Sealed plastic bag over layup
- Vacuum applied (-0.8 to -1.0 bar)
- Atmospheric pressure consolidates laminate
- Results in higher fiber volume (50-60%)

**Materials**:
- Release film (perforated for air escape)
- Bleeder cloth (absorbs excess resin)
- Breather cloth (air distribution)
- Vacuum bag (nylon or polyester film)
- Sealant tape

### Prepreg Layup

**Material Form**:
- Fabric pre-impregnated with partially cured resin
- Stored frozen (-18°C) to prevent full cure
- Shelf life: 6-12 months frozen, days at room temperature

**Process**:
1. Thaw prepreg to room temperature
2. Cut plies (by hand or automated cutter)
3. Layup on tool
4. Vacuum bag
5. Autoclave cure (120-180°C, 5-7 bar pressure)

**Advantages**:
- Consistent resin content and fiber volume (55-65%)
- Cleaner process
- Superior mechanical properties
- Reduced voids

**Disadvantages**:
- Higher material cost ($40-100/kg vs $20-40 for dry fabric+resin)
- Requires autoclave or oven
- Limited out-time before tack is lost

### Resin Transfer Molding (RTM)

**Process**:
1. Dry fabric preform placed in closed mold
2. Resin injected under pressure (2-5 bar)
3. Cure in heated mold
4. Part removed

**Advantages**:
- Both sides of part have smooth finish
- Lower VOC emissions (closed mold)
- Faster cycle time than hand layup
- Suitable for moderate production (10-1000 parts/year)

**Tooling Requirements**:
- Matched male/female molds
- Injection ports and vents
- Resin distribution channels
- Tooling cost: $10,000-$100,000 depending on size/complexity

### Pultrusion

**Process**:
- Continuous fiber pulled through resin bath
- Then through heated die (120-150°C)
- Constant cross-section profiles (rods, tubes, beams)
- Production rate: 0.1-5 m/min

**Applications**:
- Structural shapes (I-beams, channels, gratings)
- Utility poles
- Handrails

**Properties**:
- High fiber volume (60-70%)
- Unidirectional or mat reinforcement
- Excellent longitudinal properties
- Limited to constant cross-section

## Rule of Mixtures

Simple model for estimating composite properties from constituent properties.

**Longitudinal Properties (Parallel to Fibers)**:

Modulus:
$$E_c = E_f V_f + E_m V_m$$

Strength (fiber-dominated):
$$\sigma_c = \sigma_f V_f + \sigma_m' V_m$$

where $\sigma_m'$ is matrix stress at fiber failure strain.

**Transverse Properties (Perpendicular to Fibers)**:

Modulus (series model):
$$\frac{1}{E_c} = \frac{V_f}{E_f} + \frac{V_m}{E_m}$$

**Example Calculation**:

Carbon/epoxy with:
- $E_f$ = 230 GPa, $E_m$ = 3 GPa
- $V_f$ = 0.60 (60% fiber volume)

Longitudinal modulus:
$$E_c = 230(0.6) + 3(0.4) = 138 + 1.2 = 139.2 \text{ GPa}$$

Transverse modulus:
$$\frac{1}{E_c} = \frac{0.6}{230} + \frac{0.4}{3} = 0.00261 + 0.133 = 0.136$$
$$E_c = 7.4 \text{ GPa}$$

Note: Rule of mixtures provides upper bound. Actual properties often 10-20% lower due to imperfect fiber alignment, voids, and interface quality.

## Failure Modes

### Fiber-Dominated Failures

**Fiber Breakage**:
- Tensile overload parallel to fibers
- Brittle fracture, sudden failure
- Occurs at ~1.5% strain for carbon, 2% for glass

**Fiber Buckling**:
- Compression parallel to fibers
- Wavy fibers collapse
- Compression strength 40-60% of tensile for carbon

### Matrix-Dominated Failures

**Matrix Cracking**:
- Transverse tension or in-plane shear
- First ply failure (FPF) but not ultimate failure
- Multiple cracks distribute load

**Delamination**:
- Separation between plies
- Caused by interlaminar shear or normal stress
- Often from impact damage or free edge stresses
- Grows under fatigue loading

### Interface Failures

**Fiber/Matrix Debonding**:
- Loss of adhesion at interface
- Reduces load transfer efficiency
- Fiber pullout during fracture

## Testing Standards

## Summary

Composite materials offer exceptional performance through intelligent combination of reinforcing fibers and matrix materials. Understanding fiber types (carbon, glass, aramid), matrix systems (thermoset, thermoplastic), and architecture (UD, woven, sandwich) enables informed material selection for CNC machining applications.

Key considerations for CNC processing:
- Fiber orientation affects machining forces and tool wear
- Matrix type determines thermal sensitivity
- Sandwich structures require specialized fixturing
- Material cost varies 100× from glass/polyester to carbon/PEEK

Proper material selection balances performance requirements against manufacturing cost and machinability.
