# Module 24 – L.E.A.N. Strategies for CNC Manufacturing


## 24.9.1 Principles of Error Proofing

**Poka-Yoke** (Japanese: ポカヨケ) means "mistake-proofing" or "inadvertent error prevention."

**Literal translation:**
- **Poka** = inadvertent mistake
- **Yoke** = prevention

### Philosophy

**Developed by Shigeo Shingo** at Toyota in the 1960s.

**Core Principle:** Humans make mistakes. Rather than blame people, design processes and equipment to prevent mistakes or detect them immediately.

**Traditional Approach:**
- Train operators to be careful
- Inspect to catch errors
- Blame people when errors occur
- "Pay more attention!"

**Poka-Yoke Approach:**
- Assume mistakes will happen
- Design to prevent mistakes
- Or detect immediately (100% automatic inspection)
- Blame the process, not the person

**Shingo's Insight:**
*"Inspection finds defects. Poka-yoke prevents defects."*

### The Goal

**Zero Defects** through defect prevention, not defect detection.

**Hierarchy of Effectiveness:**

**Level 1: Eliminate (Best):**
- Design out the possibility of error
- Error cannot physically occur
- **Example:** Part can only fit in fixture one way (incorrect orientation impossible)

**Level 2: Prevent (Better):**
- Detect condition leading to error
- Stop process before error occurs
- **Example:** Sensor ensures blank is present before machining starts

**Level 3: Detect (Good):**
- Detect error immediately after it occurs
- Prevent error from moving downstream
- **Example:** Go/no-go gage after operation rejects out-of-spec parts

**Level 4: Inspect (Least Effective):**
- Traditional inspection
- Finds errors but doesn't prevent them
- Waste (cost of inspection + cost of defects)

**Goal: Levels 1-2 (Eliminate or Prevent)**

### Key Characteristics

**Simple:**
- Low-cost solutions
- Mechanical, not complex electronics
- Easy to understand and maintain

**Reliable:**
- Works every time
- Fail-safe design
- Doesn't depend on human memory

**Immediate:**
- Feedback instantaneous
- No delay between error and detection
- Prevents propagation

**100% Inspection:**
- Checks every part, every time
- Not sampling
- Automatic (no human effort)

## 24.9.2 Types of Poka-Yoke

### 24.9.2.1 Prevention (Control)

**Control Poka-Yoke:** Makes error impossible.

**Mechanism:**
- Physical design prevents incorrect action
- Error cannot occur
- Most effective type

**Examples:**

**1. Asymmetric Design:**
- USB connector (only inserts one way)
- Automotive gas cap (diesel nozzle won't fit gas tank)
- Electrical plugs (3-prong polarized)

**Manufacturing Example:**
- Fixture with asymmetric locating pins
- Part can only be loaded one orientation
- Loading backwards physically impossible

**2. Guide Pins/Locating Features:**
- Large pin and small pin (different diameters)
- Part has matching holes
- Prevents incorrect part installation

**3. Interlock:**
- Machine won't start unless guards closed
- CNC door interlock (spindle stops if door opens)
- Prevents unsafe operation

**4. Limit Switches:**
- Detect presence/absence before proceeding
- Part present? Proceed. Part absent? Stop.
- Prevents machining air

**5. Sequencing:**
- Steps must occur in order
- Can't skip a step
- **Example:** Program requires tool change sequence (can't run Op 2 tools without Op 1 completion)

### 24.9.2.2 Detection (Warning)

**Warning Poka-Yoke:** Detects error and alerts operator.

**Mechanism:**
- Error detected after occurrence
- Signal (light, buzzer) alerts operator
- Operator must respond

**Less Effective than Control:**
- Error has occurred (though detected quickly)
- Relies on operator response
- But still valuable when prevention not feasible

**Examples:**

**1. Sensors with Alarms:**
- Part dimensionally out of spec detected by gage
- Red light and buzzer
- Operator stops, investigates

**2. Count Verification:**
- Operation requires 4 bolts
- Counter ensures 4 bolt-tightening cycles
- Alarm if count ≠ 4

**3. Andon (Signal Lights):**
- Green = normal
- Yellow = attention needed
- Red = stop/problem
- Visual status at a glance

**4. Inspection Stations:**
- Automated 100% inspection after operation
- Rejects defects immediately
- Prevents defects going downstream

**5. Checklists with Verification:**
- Setup checklist requires sign-off
- Each item verified before proceeding
- Ensures no steps skipped

## 24.9.3 Poka-Yoke Methods

### 24.9.3.1 Contact Methods

**Physical contact or measurement detects error.**

**Techniques:**

**1. Presence/Absence Detection:**
- Sensor detects if part present
- Photoelectric, proximity, limit switch
- **Example:** Photoelectric beam across fixture—if unbroken (no part), machine won't start

**2. Dimension Detection:**
- Gage measures critical dimension
- In-tolerance: proceed. Out-of-tolerance: stop.
- **Example:** Post-process gage rejects parts >0.505" diameter

**3. Position Detection:**
- Sensor confirms correct position
- **Example:** Limit switch confirms vise fully closed before machining

**4. Shape/Feature Detection:**
- Sensor verifies feature presence
- **Example:** Vision system confirms hole drilled

**Examples in CNC:**

**Tool Presence Detection:**
- Spindle tool sensor confirms tool loaded
- Prevents running program with missing tool
- Avoids crash

**Part Loaded Detection:**
- Pressure switch in vise/clamp
- Confirms part clamped before machining
- Prevents machining air or loose part

**Workpiece Material Verification:**
- RFID tag on material
- Scanner confirms correct material before machining
- Prevents wrong material errors

### 24.9.3.2 Fixed-Value Methods

**Specific count or fixed quantity prevents error.**

**Techniques:**

**1. Counting:**
- Process requires fixed number of actions
- Counter ensures correct quantity
- **Example:** Assembly requires 6 screws; counter ensures 6 tightening cycles

**2. Checklists:**
- Fixed number of items
- All must be checked
- **Example:** Setup checklist with 10 items; can't start until all 10 checked

**3. Kitting:**
- Exact quantity of components in kit
- Empty kit = all used correctly
- Extra parts = error (missing installation)

**4. Part Dispensers:**
- Dispenses exact quantity needed
- One part per button press
- **Example:** Fastener dispenser gives exactly 4 bolts (for 4-bolt assembly)

**Examples in CNC:**

**Tool Kitting:**
- Pre-staged tool kit for job
- Exact tools needed, no more
- Kit empty at end = all tools used

**Operations Counter:**
- Program cycles counter
- Requires specific number of tool changes
- Mismatch = error (skipped operation or extra)

**Parts per Kanban:**
- Container holds exact quantity (25 parts)
- Full container = 25 parts (no more, no less)
- Over/under fill obvious

### 24.9.3.3 Motion-Step Methods

**Correct motion or sequence required.**

**Techniques:**

**1. Sequence Enforcement:**
- Steps must occur in order
- Can't skip or reverse
- **Example:** Fixture requires base clamped before top clamp can engage

**2. Motion Detection:**
- Sensor confirms motion occurred
- **Example:** Rotation sensor confirms part rotated for second-side machining

**3. Path Verification:**
- Ensures correct path taken
- **Example:** Guide rails force part along correct path through cell

**4. Standard Work Enforcement:**
- Visual or physical cues ensure correct sequence
- **Example:** Color-coded steps (do red, then yellow, then green)

**Examples in CNC:**

**Sequential Operations:**
- Fixture interlock requires Op 1 locator removed before Op 2 locator installed
- Prevents attempting Op 2 in Op 1 position

**Two-Hand Controls:**
- Require both hands to start cycle
- Prevents hands in danger zone

**Probe Cycle Verification:**
- Program requires probe cycle before machining
- Confirms work offset set
- Prevents incorrect Z-height machining

## 24.9.4 Poka-Yoke in CNC Manufacturing

### 24.9.4.1 Fixture Error Proofing

**Most Common CNC Errors: Part Loaded Incorrectly**

**Solutions:**

**1. Asymmetric Locating:**
- Locating pins of different sizes
- Part has matching holes
- Can only load one way
- **Eliminates orientation errors**

**Example:**
```
Fixture Base:     Part:
  ●                 ○ (fits large pin)
    ○                 ○ (fits small pin)
```
Part can only fit with large hole over large pin.

**2. Nesting (Enveloping):**
- Fixture closely matches part shape
- Part nests into fixture
- Incorrect part won't fit
- **Eliminates wrong part errors**

**Example:** Housing fixture shaped exactly like housing exterior. Similar part (wrong p/n) won't nest correctly.

**3. Positive Stops:**
- Hard stops for part positioning
- Repeatable location
- No adjustment needed
- **Eliminates position errors**

**4. Clamp Interlock:**
- Clamp can only close if part present and correct
- Pressure switch confirms clamping force
- **Prevents machining unclamped part**

**5. Color Coding:**
- Part family color matched to fixture color
- Visual confirmation (red part → red fixture)
- **Reduces wrong part selection**

### 24.9.4.2 Tool Loading Error Proofing

**Error: Wrong Tool in Wrong Position**

**Solutions:**

**1. Tool Identification:**
- RFID chips in tool holders
- CNC reads chip, verifies correct tool in position
- **Prevents tool mix-ups**

**2. Tool Length Verification:**
- Tool setter or probe measures length
- Compares to expected length
- Alarm if mismatch
- **Catches wrong tool or broken tool**

**3. Visual Tool Management:**
- Shadow board for tool staging
- Each tool position labeled (T1, T2, etc.)
- Missing tool obvious
- **Prevents loading errors**

**4. Pre-Set Tool Kits:**
- All tools for job in labeled tray
- Load from tray in sequence
- Empty tray = complete
- **Prevents missing tools**

**5. Spindle Probe Routine:**
- Program probes tool before using
- Verifies length and diameter
- Out-of-spec = alarm
- **Catches errors before cutting**

### 24.9.4.3 Part Orientation Devices

**Error: Part Loaded Upside-Down or Rotated**

**Solutions:**

**1. Mechanical Keying:**
- Asymmetric features prevent incorrect orientation
- Flat, chamfer, notch
- **Impossible to load wrong**

**2. Vision System:**
- Camera verifies part orientation
- Compares to reference image
- Wrong orientation = reject/alarm

**3. Probing:**
- Touch probe finds features
- Compares to expected locations
- Orientation error detected
- **Before machining starts**

**4. Gravity/Natural Orientation:**
- Part design uses gravity
- Part naturally settles to correct orientation
- **Example:** V-block for round parts (doesn't matter rotation)

**5. Labels/Marking:**
- "This Side Up" on part (temporary marking)
- Operator visual confirmation
- Least robust (relies on human)

### 24.9.4.4 Process Sequence Control

**Error: Operations Performed Out of Sequence**

**Solutions:**

**1. Separate Fixtures:**
- Op 1 fixture different from Op 2 fixture
- Can't accidentally do Op 2 first
- Physical prevention

**2. Barcode/RFID Tracking:**
- Part tagged at each operation
- Next operation scans tag
- Verifies previous operations complete
- **Prevents skipping operations**

**3. Kanban with Sequence:**
- Kanban cards color-coded by operation
- Next operation only accepts correct color card
- Visual sequence control

**4. Inspection Checkpoints:**
- Feature inspection after each operation
- Next operation verifies previous features present
- **Example:** Op 2 requires drilled holes; checks for holes before proceeding

**5. Program Sequencing:**
- CNC program embedded checks
- Probe cycles verify previous operation features
- Won't proceed if features missing

### 24.9.4.5 Inspection Error Proofing

**Error: Incorrect Measurement or Gage**

**Solutions:**

**1. Go/No-Go Gages:**
- No interpretation needed
- Part fits or doesn't fit
- **Eliminates measurement error**

**2. Gage R&R:**
- Gages calibrated and verified
- Measurement system capable
- Reduces gage variation

**3. Digital Gages with Limits:**
- Set upper/lower limits
- Green light = pass, Red = fail
- No interpretation

**4. Automated Inspection:**
- CMM, vision system, in-machine probing
- Eliminates human error
- 100% inspection possible

**5. Dedicated Gages:**
- One gage per feature (can't use wrong gage)
- Labeled clearly
- Shadow board at station

**6. SPC with Alarms:**
- Automatic plotting
- Out-of-control alarm

## 24.9.6 Implementing Poka-Yoke

### Step-by-Step Process

**Step 1: Identify Error-Prone Operations**

**Sources:**
- Scrap/rework data (where do defects occur?)
- Operator input (what mistakes happen?)
- Customer complaints
- Near-miss reports

**Prioritize by:**
- Frequency (how often?)
- Severity (cost of error)

**Step 2: Root Cause Analysis**

**Why does the error occur?**
- Lack of information? (unclear instructions)
- Physically difficult? (hard to see, reach)
- Reliance on memory? (too many steps)
- Similar parts/tools? (easy to confuse)
- Fatigue? (repetitive, boring)

**Use 5 Whys:**
- Defect: Part loaded backwards
- Why? Operator didn't check orientation
- Why? Part looks similar both ways
- Why? No obvious front/back indicator
- Why? Not designed with orientation feature
- **Root cause:** Design lacks orientation feature

**Step 3: Design Poka-Yoke**

**Brainstorm Solutions:**
- How to eliminate error? (Level 1)
- How to prevent error? (Level 2)
- How to detect immediately? (Level 3)

**Select Best Solution:**

**Install:**
- Integrate into process
- Minimal disruption

**Document:**
- Update standard work
- Include poka-yoke in training

**Step 5: Verify**

**Test:**
- Intentionally try to make error (safely!)
- Does poka-yoke prevent/detect?

**Monitor:**
- Track defects after implementation
- Did they eliminate?
- Sustain improvement

**Step 6: Standardize and Replicate**

**Share Success:**
- Document the solution
- Photos, drawings, description

**Replicate:**
- Apply to similar operations
- Other machines, products, areas

**Culture:**
- Encourage operator ideas
- Reward poka-yoke suggestions
- Make it a habit

## Summary

Poka-Yoke (mistake-proofing) prevents errors by designing processes and equipment to eliminate, prevent, or immediately detect mistakes. Developed by Shigeo Shingo, poka-yoke shifts from blaming people to improving processes. The most effective poka-yoke eliminates the possibility of error entirely through clever design.

In CNC manufacturing, poka-yoke prevents common errors: incorrect part orientation, wrong tools, skipped operations, and measurement mistakes. Simple, low-cost solutions (locating pins, limit switches, color-coding) often provide dramatic ROI by eliminating scrap and rework.

The key is systematic implementation: identify error-prone operations, determine root causes, design simple solutions, verify effectiveness, and replicate successes. When combined with other Lean tools, poka-yoke builds quality into processes and supports zero-defect goals.
