**Phase 1: Fundamentals (Months 1-3)**
1. Read: *Build Your Own CNC Machine* (James Floyd Kelly)
2. Watch: NYC CNC YouTube channel (all "CNC Basics" videos)
3. Join: CNCzone forum, introduce yourself, read "sticky" posts
4. Software: Install FreeCAD or Fusion 360, complete online tutorials (2-3 hours/week)

**Phase 2: Design and Planning (Months 3-6)**
1. Read: *Precision Machine Design* (Slocum) - Chapter 1 (error budgets)
2. Design: Sketch your CNC machine concept in CAD (X/Y/Z axes, dimensions)
3. Calculate: Motor sizing using Appendix C formulas (practice problems)
4. Community: Post design for feedback on r/hobbycnc or CNCzone

**Phase 3: Construction (Months 6-12)**
1. Source: Order components (use Appendix K vendor list)
2. Assemble: Follow course modules (mechanical frame → motion → electronics)
3. Document: Take photos, keep build log (helps troubleshooting later)
4. Test: Calibrate each axis individually before full integration

**Phase 4: Mastery (Ongoing)**
1. Read: *Machinery's Handbook* (reference for specific projects)
2. Practice: G-code programming (use Appendix F reference)
3. Experiment: Try different materials, cutting strategies
4. Share: Post completed projects, help others in community
