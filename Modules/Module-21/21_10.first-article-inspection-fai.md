# Module 21 – Metrology and Precision Measurement


Effective inspection planning ensures parts meet specifications efficiently while maintaining traceability and documentation for quality management systems.

## 21.10.1 First Article Inspection (FAI)

First Article Inspection is a comprehensive inspection of the first production part(s) to verify the manufacturing process produces parts meeting all design requirements.

### Purpose of FAI

**Verify**:
- Manufacturing process capability
- Tooling and fixturing adequacy
- Program accuracy
- Drawing interpretation
- Supplier understanding of requirements

**When Required**:
- New part introduction
- After engineering change
- Process change (new machine, method, location)
- After significant production break
- Customer or contract requirement

### FAI Standards

**AS9102**: Aerospace First Article Inspection Requirement
- Defines documentation and procedures
- Form 1: Part number accountability
- Form 2: Product accountability (characteristic accountability)
- Form 3: Characteristic accountability and verification

**Industry Specific**: Automotive (PPAP), Medical (Design History File), etc.

### FAI Process

**Step 1: Planning**
- Identify all characteristics on drawing
- Determine measurement method for each feature
- Establish datum reference frames
- Select appropriate instruments

**Step 2: Measurement**
- Measure all characteristics
- Record actual values (not just pass/fail)
- Include measurement uncertainty where applicable
- Photograph or scan critical features

**Step 3: Documentation**
- Complete forms (AS9102 or equivalent)
- Record measurements vs. specifications
- Note any deviations
- Reference calibrated instruments used

**Step 4: Review and Approval**
- Engineering review
- Quality review
- Customer approval (if required)

**Step 5: Retention**
- Maintain records per customer/industry requirements
- Typically 7-10 years or life of program

### FAI Documentation

**Required Information**:
- Part number, revision, quantity
- Customer name and purchase order
- All dimensional characteristics
- Material verification
- Special processes (heat treat, plating, etc.)
- Inspection equipment used
- Inspector and date
- Approval signatures

**Supporting Documents**:
- Engineering drawing
- Material certifications
- Process certifications (heat treat, NDT, etc.)
- Instrument calibration records
- Photographs or comparison to master

## 21.10.2 Production Part Approval Process (PPAP)

PPAP is the automotive industry standard for part approval (defined by AIAG - Automotive Industry Action Group).

### PPAP Purpose

Demonstrates that:
- Supplier understands customer requirements
- Process can consistently produce conforming parts
- Actual production process, tooling, and equipment will be used

### PPAP Levels

**Level 1**: Part Submission Warrant (PSW) only
- Lowest level, minimal documentation

**Level 2**: PSW with product samples and limited supporting data

**Level 3**: PSW with product samples and complete supporting data
- Most common level

**Level 4**: PSW and complete supporting data for review at supplier's site

**Level 5**: PSW and complete supporting data reviewed at customer's site
- Highest level, typically for critical parts

### PPAP Requirements (Level 3)

**18 Elements**:

1. Design Records (if supplier responsible for design)
2. Engineering Change Documents (authorization)
3. Customer Engineering Approval (if required)
4. Design FMEA (if supplier responsible)
5. Process Flow Diagram
6. Process FMEA
7. Control Plan
8. Measurement System Analysis (MSA/Gage R&R)
9. Dimensional Results (inspection data)
10. Material/Performance Test Results
11. Initial Process Studies (capability studies)
12. Qualified Laboratory Documentation
13. Appearance Approval Report (AAR) if applicable
14. Sample Product (physical samples)
15. Master Sample (retained by supplier)
16. Checking Aids (fixtures, gages)
17. Customer-Specific Requirements
18. Part Submission Warrant (PSW)

### Control Plan

The Control Plan is a living document describing how quality will be controlled during production.

**Content**:
- Part number and description
- Process steps
- Characteristics to be controlled at each step
- Methods and specifications
- Sample size and frequency
- Control method (SPC, 100% inspection, etc.)
- Reaction plan for out-of-spec conditions

**Types**:
- **Prototype**: During development
- **Pre-Launch**: Before full production
- **Production**: Ongoing manufacturing

### Initial Process Capability Studies

Required for special characteristics:

**Data Collection**:
- Minimum 25-30 subgroups
- Subgroup size typically 3-5 parts
- Consecutive production
- Stable process conditions

**Analysis**:
- Calculate Cpk
- Typical minimum requirement: Cpk ≥ 1.33
- Critical characteristics: Cpk ≥ 1.67

**Actions if Insufficient Capability**:
- 100% inspection until improved
- Increase control plan monitoring
- Document containment plan

## 21.10.3 Inspection Planning from Drawings

Effective inspection planning translates drawing requirements into measurement procedures.

### Analyzing the Drawing

**Step 1: Identify All Features**
- Dimensions and tolerances
- GD&T callouts
- Surface finish
- Material specifications
- Notes and general tolerances

**Step 2: Classify Characteristics**

**Critical**: Affects safety or regulatory compliance
- 100% inspection or very frequent sampling
- Tightest controls

**Major**: Affects fit, form, function
- SPC monitoring or periodic sampling
- Standard controls

**Minor**: Non-functional, appearance
- Periodic sampling
- Reduced controls

**Step 3: Establish Datum Reference Frames**
- Identify datum features in order (A, B, C)
- Determine how to simulate datums physically
- Plan fixture or measurement sequence

**Step 4: Select Measurement Methods**

Consider:
- Tolerance magnitude (10:1 rule)
- Feature type (hole, slot, profile, etc.)
- Access (internal, external, small, large)
- Production volume (dedicated gage vs. CMM)
- Cost and cycle time

### Inspection Documentation

**Inspection Plan** includes:

**For Each Characteristic**:
1. Feature description
2. Specification and tolerance
3. Measurement method
4. Instrument required (with ID number)
5. Sample size and frequency
6. Acceptance criteria
7. Reaction plan if out of spec

**Example Entry**:
```
Feature: Hole Ø10.00 +0.05/-0.00
Method: Dial bore gage
Instrument: DBG-001 (cal due 6/2025)
Frequency: First piece, last piece, every 25th piece
Accept: 9.95-10.05 mm
React: Stop production, notify supervisor, 100% sort
```

### Measurement Sequence

**Logical Order**:
1. Establish primary datum (typically on surface plate)
2. Establish secondary and tertiary datums
3. Measure features in order that maintains datum reference
4. Avoid re-handling that loses datum reference

**Efficiency**:
- Group measurements by instrument
- Group by setup or orientation
- Minimize part handling
- Consider dedicated fixtures for high volume

## 21.10.4 Measuring Uncertainty and Reporting

Measurement uncertainty quantifies the doubt in a measurement result.

### Sources of Uncertainty

**Type A** (Statistical):
- Repeatability of instrument
- Reproducibility between operators
- Environmental variation

**Type B** (Other sources):
- Calibration uncertainty
- Resolution uncertainty
- Temperature effects
- Instrument drift
- Fixture errors

### Calculating Combined Uncertainty

**Simplified Approach**:

```
U_combined = √(u₁² + u₂² + u₃² + ... + uₙ²)
```

Where u₁, u₂, etc. are individual uncertainty components

**Example**:
- Calibration uncertainty: ±0.002 mm
- Repeatability (from Gage R&R): ±0.003 mm
- Temperature effect: ±0.001 mm

```
U_combined = √(0.002² + 0.003² + 0.001²)
U_combined = √(0.000004 + 0.000009 + 0.000001)
U_combined = √0.000014 = 0.0037 mm
```

**Expanded Uncertainty** (95% confidence):
```
U = k × U_combined
```
Where k = 2 for 95% confidence

**Example**: U = 2 × 0.0037 = 0.007 mm

### Reporting Measurements

**Proper Format**:
```
Measured value: 25.347 mm ± 0.007 mm (k=2)
```

Or:
```
Measured value: 25.347 mm
Measurement uncertainty: ±0.007 mm (95% confidence)
```

### Decision Rules (ISO 14253-1)

When measurement uncertainty is significant relative to tolerance:

**Simple Acceptance**: Accept if measured value is within specification limits
- Risk of accepting parts that are actually out of spec

**Strict Acceptance** (Guard Banding): Accept only if measured value is within reduced limits
- Reduced limits = Spec limits minus uncertainty
- Conservative but reduces risk

**Example**:
- Specification: 25.00 ±0.05 mm (24.95-25.05)
- Measurement uncertainty: ±0.01 mm
- Guard band limits: 24.96-25.04 mm
