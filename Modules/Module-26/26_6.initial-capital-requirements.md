# Module 26 – CNC Business Ownership and Management


## Overview

Understanding startup costs and securing adequate financing are critical to launching a successful CNC business. Undercapitalization—starting with insufficient funds—is one of the primary reasons new businesses fail. Many aspiring shop owners underestimate costs, overestimate revenue, and run out of cash before reaching profitability.

This section provides realistic cost breakdowns for different shop sizes, identifies all the expenses you'll face (not just equipment), explores financing options from bootstrapping to SBA loans, and presents financial projections for best-case, worst-case, and realistic scenarios.

**Critical Reality:** You will need significantly more capital than you initially think. Plan for the realistic scenario, hope for the best case, but prepare financially for the worst case.

## 6.1 Initial Capital Requirements

### 6.1.1 Equipment Costs (Best, Worst, Normal Scenarios)

Equipment is typically the largest startup expense, but costs vary dramatically based on new vs. used, size, and capabilities.

2. **Support Equipment Adds Up:** Bandsaw, air compressor, benches, tooling cabinets, carts—easily $10K-30K.

3. **Tooling is Expensive:** A complete tooling inventory for one machine is $5K-15K. Don't underestimate.

4. **Inspection Equipment Required:** Quality work requires quality measurement. Budget $3K-15K minimum.

### 6.1.2 Facility Costs

**Lease Costs (Most Common for Startups):**

**Deposits and Initial Costs:**
- First month's rent
- Last month's rent (sometimes)
- Security deposit (1-2 months rent)
- Broker fees (sometimes 1 month rent)

**Example:**
```
Facility: 2,500 sq ft @ $8/sq ft/month = $1,667/month

Initial costs:
First month: $1,667
Last month: $1,667
Security deposit: $3,334 (2 months)
Total upfront: $6,668
```

**Facility Improvements:**

Most industrial spaces are "warm shell" (basic building, you add everything else):

| Improvement | Micro Shop | Small Shop | Medium Shop |
|-------------|------------|------------|-------------|
| **Electrical Upgrades** | 3-phase power install: $3K-8K | Additional circuits, panel: $8K-15K | Full electrical upgrade: $15K-40K |

**Note:** CAM software is the largest expense. Perpetual licenses have high upfront cost but lower ongoing. Subscriptions spread cost but add up over time.

### 6.1.5 Working Capital Reserve

**Working Capital:** Cash needed to fund operations before revenue covers expenses.

**Why You Need It:**
- Revenue ramps slowly (Months 1-3 often $0)
- Customers pay in 30-60 days (you incur costs before receiving payment)
- Unexpected expenses arise
- Buffer against cash flow timing differences

**Calculating Working Capital Needs:**

**Method 1: Months of Operating Expenses**

**Rule of Thumb:** 3-6 months of operating expenses (not including owner salary initially).

**Example (Small Shop):**
```
Monthly operating expenses:
Rent: $2,000
Utilities: $600
Insurance: $800
Equipment loans: $2,500
Materials (estimated avg): $2,000
Supplies: $500
Software: $200
Misc: $400
TOTAL: $9,000/month

Working Capital (6 months): $54,000
```

**Method 2: Cash Flow Projection**

Project monthly cash in/out for first 12 months. Working capital = maximum cumulative cash deficit.

**Example:**
```
Month 1: Revenue $0, Expenses $12,000 → Need $12,000
Month 2: Revenue $2,000, Expenses $10,000 → Need $8,000 more = $20,000 cumulative
Month 3: Revenue $5,000, Expenses $10,000 → Need $5,000 more = $25,000 cumulative
Month 4: Revenue $8,000, Expenses $10,000 → Need $2,000 more = $27,000 cumulative (peak)
Month 5: Revenue $12,000, Expenses $10,000 → Positive $2,000, reduces need to $25,000
...

Working capital needed: $27,000 (peak deficit)
```

**Recommended Working Capital:**

| Shop Size | Working Capital Reserve |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| Micro Shop | $15,000-30,000 (3-6 months expenses) |
| Small Shop | $35,000-70,000 (4-6 months expenses) |
| Medium Shop | $75,000-150,000 (6-9 months expenses) |

**Critical:** Don't skimp on working capital. Running out of cash kills businesses.

## 6.3 Financing Options

### 6.3.1 Personal Savings and Bootstrapping

**Bootstrapping:** Self-funding business through personal savings, revenue reinvestment, and minimal external financing.

**Advantages:**
- ✓ No debt or interest payments
- ✓ Retain 100% ownership and control
- ✓ No lender/investor approval or oversight
- ✓ Build business on solid foundation (profitability from day 1)
- ✓ Forces financial discipline

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ Limits growth speed (constrained by available capital)
- ✗ Personal financial risk (using your savings)
- ✗ Opportunity cost (money not invested elsewhere)
- ✗ May start too small to be viable
- ✗ Slower to reach profitability at scale

**When Bootstrapping Works:**
- You have substantial savings ($50K-150K+)
- Starting very small (micro shop, part-time)
- Low-risk testing of business concept
- Can maintain other income during startup
- Patient growth mindset (5-10 year horizon)

**Bootstrapping Strategies:**
- Start with 1 used machine, add equipment from profits
- Home-based initially, move to facility when revenue justifies
- Owner does all work initially (no employees)
- Delay non-essential expenses (fancy website, marketing, certifications)
- Reinvest all profits for first 2-3 years

**Example Bootstrap Timeline:**
```
Year 1: Personal savings $50K → Buy used mill, home-based, solo
        Revenue: $80K, Profit: $25K (reinvest)
Year 2: Add used lathe ($30K from Y1 profit)
        Revenue: $140K, Profit: $45K (reinvest)
Year 3: Move to small facility, add employee
        Revenue: $220K, Profit: $35K (after facility/employee costs)
Year 4: Add 2nd mill
        Revenue: $340K, Profit: $70K
```

**Reality:** Bootstrapping is slow but builds debt-free, sustainable business. Best for those with patience and adequate personal finances.

### 6.3.2 SBA Loans

**SBA (Small Business Administration) Loans:** Government-backed loans designed to help small businesses access capital.

**How SBA Loans Work:**
- SBA doesn't lend money directly (except in disasters)
- SBA guarantees portion of loan (75-85%), reducing lender risk
- Banks and lenders provide the actual loan funds
- SBA guarantee allows better terms than conventional loans

**Popular SBA Loan Programs:**

**SBA 7(a) Loan (Most Common)**

**Use:** General business purposes (working capital, equipment, real estate, refinancing)

**Amount:** Up to $5 million (typically $50K-500K for small manufacturers)

**Terms:**
- Working capital: Up to 10 years
- Equipment: Up to 10 years
- Real estate: Up to 25 years
- Interest rates: Prime + 2-4% (variable) or fixed equivalent
- Current rates: ~8-11% (as of 2024)

**Down Payment:** 10-20% typically

**Guarantee Fee:** 2-3.75% of guaranteed portion (rolled into loan)

**Requirements:**
- Business plan
- Personal credit score 680+ (ideally 720+)
- Business revenue or collateral
- Personal guarantee from owner(s) with >20% ownership
- Collateral (equipment, real estate, personal assets)

**Timeline:** 60-90 days from application to funding

**Example:**
```
SBA 7(a) Loan: $150,000
Term: 10 years
Rate: 9.5%
Monthly payment: $1,938
Total interest: $82,560

Use: $50K working capital, $100K equipment
```

**SBA 504 Loan**

**Use:** Long-term fixed assets (real estate, major equipment)

**Structure:** Two loans:
- Bank loan: 50% of project cost
- SBA 504 loan (through CDC): 40% of project cost
- Borrower down payment: 10% (or 15% for new business)

**Amount:** Up to $5 million (up to $5.5M for manufacturing/energy projects)

**Terms:**
- 10, 20, or 25 years (based on asset life)
- Fixed rates (typically 5-7%)

**Example:**
```
Building purchase: $500,000
Bank loan (50%): $250,000 @ 8% (25-year)
SBA 504 (40%): $200,000 @ 6% fixed (25-year)
Down payment (10%): $50,000

Monthly payment: Bank $1,929 + SBA $1,288 = $3,217
```

**SBA Microloan**

**Use:** Startups and very small businesses
**Amount:** Up to $50,000 (average ~$13,000)
**Terms:** Up to 6 years, rates 8-13%
**Best for:** Very small startups, difficult to qualify for traditional SBA

**Applying for SBA Loan:**

**1. Prepare Documents:**
- Business plan (comprehensive)
- Personal financial statement
- Business financial projections (3 years)
- Tax returns (personal, 3 years; business if existing)
- Resume demonstrating industry experience
- Legal documents (articles of incorporation, licenses)
- Collateral documentation

**2. Find SBA Lender:**
- Check SBA.gov for approved lenders
- Local banks and credit unions
- National SBA lenders (Live Oak Bank, etc.)

**3. Application Process:**
- Submit application and documents
- Lender reviews creditworthiness
- SBA reviews and approves guarantee
- Closing and funding

**4. Timeline:**
- 60-90 days typical
- Can be longer if documentation incomplete

**Pros and Cons:**

**Advantages:**
- ✓ Lower down payments than conventional (10-20% vs. 30-40%)
- ✓ Longer terms (lower monthly payments)
- ✓ Fixed rates available (stability)
- ✓ Accessible to startups and smaller businesses

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ Extensive documentation and paperwork
- ✗ Longer approval process
- ✗ Personal guarantee required (personal liability)
- ✗ Collateral required
- ✗ Guarantee fees add cost

### 6.3.3 Equipment Financing and Leasing

**Equipment Financing:** Loan specifically for purchasing equipment, where equipment serves as collateral.

**How It Works:**
- Lender loans 80-100% of equipment cost
- Equipment is collateral (lender has lien)
- Fixed monthly payments over term (3-7 years typical)
- You own equipment at end of term

**Terms:**
- Amount: Up to equipment value (some lenders 100%, others 80-90%)
- Down payment: 0-20%
- Interest rates: 5-12% depending on credit, equipment, lender
- Term: 3-7 years (matches equipment useful life)

**Example:**
```
Haas VF-4 CNC Mill: $135,000
Down payment (10%): $13,500
Financed: $121,500
Term: 7 years
Rate: 7.5%
Monthly payment: $1,935
Total interest: $41,440
```

**Advantages:**
- ✓ Preserve working capital (don't tie up cash in equipment)
- ✓ Fixed payments (budgeting)
- ✓ Tax benefits (Section 179 deduction may still apply, interest deductible)
- ✓ Easier approval than unsecured loans (equipment is collateral)
- ✓ Build business credit

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ Interest cost (pay more total than cash purchase)
- ✗ Obligation even if equipment breaks or business struggles
- ✗ Lender lien (can't sell equipment without paying off loan)

**Equipment Leasing:**

**Operating Lease:**
- Rent equipment for term (2-5 years)
- Return at end or buy out (fair market value)
- Like renting (you don't own)

**Finance Lease (Capital Lease):**
- Structured like loan
- Option to purchase at end for nominal amount ($1 buyout)
- Essentially financing with different tax treatment

**Lease Payments:**
```
Haas VF-4: $135,000
Operating lease: 5 years
Monthly payment: $2,800-3,200 (typical)
End of term: Return or buyout at FMV (~$40K-50K)

Finance lease: 7 years
Monthly payment: ~$2,100
End of term: $1 buyout (you own)
```

**Leasing Advantages:**
- ✓ Lower monthly payments than financing (operating lease)
- ✓ Upgrade flexibility (return and lease newer equipment)
- ✓ 100% financing (no down payment often)
- ✓ May be easier approval
- ✓ Off balance sheet (operating lease, accounting treatment)

**Leasing Disadvantages:**
- ✗ No ownership (operating lease)
- ✗ Higher total cost than buying
- ✗ Locked into payments for term
- ✗ Mileage/usage restrictions sometimes
- ✗ Penalties for early termination

**Buy vs. Lease Decision:**

**Buy (Finance) If:**
- You plan to keep equipment long-term (7-10+ years)
- You want to build equity
- You have down payment capital
- Equipment holds value well

**Lease If:**
- You want lower monthly payments
- You want flexibility to upgrade
- You lack down payment capital
- Technology changes rapidly (want newer equipment in 3-5 years)
- Testing business viability

**Most CNC Shops:** Finance used equipment (good value, long useful life), potentially lease specialized or expensive equipment.

### 6.3.4 Business Lines of Credit

**Line of Credit (LOC):** Revolving credit account allowing you to borrow up to a limit, repay, and borrow again.

**How It Works:**
- Approved for credit limit (e.g., $50,000)
- Borrow as needed (draw $10K, repay, draw $15K, etc.)
- Pay interest only on outstanding balance
- Revolves (unlike term loan that amortizes to $0)

**Terms:**
- Limit: $10K-250K typical for small businesses
- Interest rate: Prime + 2-6% (variable) = ~10-15% currently
- Draw period: 1-3 years (can borrow)
- Repayment: Interest-only or minimum payment during draw period
- May convert to term loan after draw period

**Secured vs. Unsecured:**
- **Secured:** Backed by collateral (receivables, inventory, equipment) → lower rates
- **Unsecured:** No collateral → higher rates, lower limits, harder to qualify

**Example:**
```
Line of Credit: $50,000 limit
Interest rate: 12% annual (1% monthly)

Month 1: Borrow $15,000 (buy materials)
        Interest: $150
Month 2: Customer pays, you repay $10,000. Balance: $5,000
        Interest: $50
Month 3: Borrow $20,000 (big order). Balance: $25,000
        Interest: $250
```

**Uses:**
- Working capital management (smooth cash flow timing)
- Material purchases (especially large orders)
- Seasonal fluctuations
- Emergency expenses
- Opportunities (rush job requires material purchase)

**Advantages:**
- ✓ Flexibility (borrow only what you need, when you need)
- ✓ Pay interest only on outstanding balance
- ✓ Revolving (doesn't decrease like term loan)
- ✓ Quick access to funds
- ✓ Smooths cash flow gaps

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ Variable interest rates (can increase)
- ✗ Temptation to overuse (easy access to money)
- ✗ Fees (annual fee, draw fee, sometimes)
- ✗ Personal guarantee usually required
- ✗ Can be called/reduced if business performance declines

**When to Get LOC:**
- During startup (have available before you desperately need it)
- When business is strong (easier approval)
- For cash flow management, not long-term financing

**Typical LOC for CNC Shops:**
- Micro shop: $10K-25K
- Small shop: $25K-75K
- Medium shop: $50K-150K

### 6.3.5 Investors and Partners

**Equity Investors:** Individuals or firms who invest money in exchange for ownership stake.

**Types:**

**Friends and Family:**
- People you know invest $5K-50K
- Informal or formal equity stake
- Easiest to access but can strain relationships

**Angel Investors:**
- High-net-worth individuals invest $25K-500K
- Seek equity (10-40%)
- Provide mentorship and connections
- Rare for CNC job shops (not high-growth tech)

**Venture Capital:**
- Institutional investors invest $1M+
- Seek high growth and eventual exit (IPO or sale)
- **Not applicable to most CNC shops** (not scalable high-growth model)

**Advantages:**
- ✓ No repayment obligation (not a loan)
- ✓ Partner shares risk
- ✓ Brings expertise, connections, mentorship
- ✓ More capital available than you could borrow

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ Give up ownership and control
- ✗ Share profits forever
- ✗ Investor may want say in decisions
- ✗ Complex legal agreements
- ✗ Difficult to buy out later
- ✗ Potential for conflict

**When Investors Make Sense:**
- You lack capital and can't borrow enough
- You value partner's expertise and network
- You're okay sharing ownership and profits
- Growth potential justifies dilution

**Reality Check for CNC Shops:**
Most CNC job shops are NOT investor-suitable:
- Moderate growth potential (not 10x returns investors seek)
- Capital-intensive with moderate margins
- Better suited to debt financing (loans) than equity

**Exceptions:**
- Highly specialized niche with huge growth potential
- Proprietary product/process (not job shop)
- Investor has strategic value (customer connections, industry expertise)

### 6.3.6 Grants and Government Programs

**Grants:** Free money (non-repayable) for specific purposes.

**Reality Check:** Grants are rare, competitive, and limited for manufacturing businesses.

**Potential Grant Sources:**

**Federal:**
- **SBIR/STTR (Small Business Innovation Research):** For R&D, technology development (rarely applicable to job shops)
- **Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP):** Subsidized consulting, not direct grants
- **Workforce Development Grants:** Training grants (not equipment/startup)

**State/Local:**
- **Economic Development Grants:** Some states/cities offer grants to attract businesses (job creation, distressed areas)
- **Equipment Grants:** Rare, but some regions offer equipment grants for manufacturers
- **Training Grants:** Employee training subsidies

**Example Programs (Vary by State):**
- Georgia: Quick Start (free employee training)
- Ohio: 166 Direct Loan (low-interest equipment financing)
- Pennsylvania: Manufacturing PA (grants up to $150K for equipment)

**How to Find:**
- SBA.gov (federal programs)
- State economic development agency
- Local chamber of commerce
- NTMA, MEP centers (resources)

**Applying for Grants:**
- Extensive application process
- Specific requirements (job creation, location, industry)
- Competitive (low approval rate)
- Long timeline (6-12 months typical)

**Don't Count On Grants:**
Hope for the best, but plan your financing without assuming grants. If you receive one, it's a bonus.

**Other Government Programs:**

**SBA Counseling (Free):**
- SCORE: Free mentoring from retired executives
- Small Business Development Centers (SBDC): Free/low-cost consulting
- Women's Business Centers (WBC)

**Tax Incentives:**
- Opportunity Zones (tax benefits for investing in designated areas)
- New Markets Tax Credits (low-income areas)
- R&D Tax Credits (if doing R&D work)

## 6.4 Managing Debt and Leverage

**Leverage:** Using borrowed money to finance business.

**Good Debt vs. Bad Debt:**

**Good Debt:**
- ✓ Finances productive assets (equipment that generates revenue)
- ✓ Affordable payments (cash flow covers comfortably)
- ✓ Reasonable interest rate (8-12%)
- ✓ Builds business credit

**Bad Debt:**
- ✗ High-interest debt (credit cards 18-24%)
- ✗ Unaffordable payments (strains cash flow)
- ✗ Debt for non-productive purposes (covering losses)
- ✗ Over-leveraged (too much debt relative to equity)

**Debt Ratios:**

**Debt-to-Equity Ratio:**
```
Debt-to-Equity = Total Liabilities ÷ Total Equity

Example: $150K debt, $100K equity = 1.5

Interpretation:
< 1.0 = Conservative (less debt than equity)
1.0-2.0 = Moderate (typical for small businesses)
> 2.0 = Aggressive (high leverage, risky)
```

**Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR):**
```
DSCR = Operating Cash Flow ÷ Annual Debt Payments

Example: $60K cash flow, $42K annual debt payments = 1.43

Interpretation:
< 1.0 = Trouble (can't cover debt payments)
1.0-1.25 = Tight (little margin for error)
1.25-2.0 = Healthy (can comfortably cover debt)
> 2.0 = Very healthy (significant cushion)

Lenders typically require DSCR > 1.25
```

**Managing Debt Responsibly:**

**1. Borrow for the Right Reasons:**
- Equipment that increases capacity/revenue
- Working capital for growth
- Real estate (builds equity)
- NOT: Covering operating losses, personal expenses

**2. Ensure Cash Flow Covers Payments:**
- Project cash flow before borrowing
- Include debt service in budget
- Maintain cushion (DSCR > 1.25)

**3. Shop for Best Terms:**
- Compare multiple lenders
- Negotiate rates and terms
- Read fine print (prepayment penalties, fees)

**4. Don't Over-Leverage:**
- Start conservatively
- Add debt as revenue grows
- Maintain equity cushion

**5. Prioritize High-Interest Debt:**
- Pay off credit cards first (18-24%)
- Pay down lines of credit when able
- Keep lower-rate equipment loans

**6. Build Credit:**
- Pay on time (always)
- Use credit responsibly
- Monitor business credit reports (Dun & Bradstreet, Experian Business)

- Operating Expenses: $185,000 (added employee)
- Operating Profit: $91,250
- Owner Compensation: $70,000
- Reinvest/Save: $21,250

**Cumulative:** Profitable from Year 1, strong growth, owner earning $70K+ by Year 3, building equity and savings.

### 6.5.2 Worst Case Scenario

**Assumptions:**
- Economic downturn or weak demand
- Few existing customer relationships
- Startup delays (equipment issues, facility problems)
- Low utilization (30-40%)
- Pricing pressure from competition

**Small Shop Example (Worst Case):**

**Year 1:**
- Revenue: $85,000
- COGS (40%, inefficiency): $34,000
- Gross Profit: $51,000 (60%)
- Operating Expenses: $105,000
- Operating Loss: -$54,000
- Owner Compensation: $0 (taking side work to survive)
- Funded by: Working capital reserve

**Year 2:**
- Revenue: $140,000 (+65%, improving)
- COGS (38%): $53,200
- Gross Profit: $86,800 (62%)
- Operating Expenses: $110,000
- Operating Loss: -$23,200
- Owner Compensation: $15,000 (partial, still tight)
- Funded by: Remaining working capital + side income

**Year 3:**
- Revenue: $195,000 (+39%)
- COGS (36%): $70,200
- Gross Profit: $124,800 (64%)
- Operating Expenses: $115,000
- Operating Profit: $9,800
- Owner Compensation: $35,000 (finally breaking even, still below employee equivalent)

**Cumulative:** Losses first 2 years, marginal profit Year 3, depleted working capital, owner struggling financially, considering whether to continue or shut down.

### 6.5.3 Realistic Normal Scenario

**Assumptions:**
- Moderate demand, steady customer acquisition
- Some existing relationships but mostly new customers
- Normal startup challenges (delays, learning curve)
- 50-60% utilization Year 1, growing to 75% by Year 3

**Small Shop Example (Normal Case):**

**Year 1:**
- Revenue: $152,000
- COGS (37%): $56,240
- Gross Profit: $95,760 (63%)
- Operating Expenses: $108,000
- Operating Loss: -$12,240
- Owner Compensation: $0
- Funded by: Working capital reserve

**Year 2:**
- Revenue: $227,000 (+49%)
- COGS (36%): $81,720
- Gross Profit: $145,280 (64%)
- Operating Expenses: $115,000
- Operating Profit: $30,280
- Owner Compensation: $30,000

**Year 3:**
- Revenue: $295,000 (+30%)
- COGS (35%): $103,250
- Gross Profit: $191,750 (65%)
- Operating Expenses: $130,000 (added part-time help)
- Operating Profit: $61,750
- Owner Compensation: $55,000
- Reinvest: $6,750

**Cumulative:** Small loss Year 1 (expected), profitable Year 2, healthy profit Year 3, owner making reasonable income by Year 3, business sustainable and positioned for continued growth.

**Key Insight:**
The "normal" case includes a loss in Year 1—this is typical and expected. Working capital reserve covers this. Don't panic if Year 1 is unprofitable; focus on trajectory.

## Conclusion

Starting a CNC business requires substantial capital—typically $50K-$300K+ depending on scale. Undercapitalization is a leading cause of failure, so realistic budgeting and adequate financing are critical.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Total Costs Exceed Equipment Alone:** Equipment is 40-60% of startup costs. Facility, inventory, software, working capital, and miscellaneous expenses add up quickly.

2. **Working Capital is Critical:** Budget 3-6 months of operating expenses as cash reserve. You WILL need it.

3. **Best, Normal, Worst Scenarios:** Plan for the normal scenario financially, hope for best case, but ensure you can survive worst case (at least 12-18 months).

4. **Financing Mix:** Most successful startups combine owner equity (25-40%), equipment financing (40-50%), and SBA loan or LOC (20-35%).

5. **Bootstrap When Possible:** Less debt = lower risk and greater flexibility. Start small and grow from profits if you have the patience and personal finances.

6. **Manage Debt Wisely:** Borrow for productive assets, ensure cash flow covers payments comfortably (DSCR > 1.25), avoid over-leveraging.

7. **Expect Year 1 Loss:** Most new shops lose money in Year 1. This is normal if you've budgeted for it with working capital.

8. **3-5 Year Timeline:** Reaching profitability and owner income comparable to employment typically takes 3-5 years. This is a marathon, not a sprint.

**Financial planning and adequate capitalization give you the runway to survive the challenging early years and build a sustainable, profitable business. Don't skimp on planning or capital—your success depends on it.**
