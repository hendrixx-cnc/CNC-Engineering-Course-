# Module 26 – CNC Business Ownership and Management


## Overview

Taxes are one of the largest expenses for any business—often 25-40% of profit goes to federal, state, and local taxes. While taxes are unavoidable, strategic tax planning can legally minimize your burden and maximize your after-tax profit. Understanding tax obligations, deadlines, deductions, and planning strategies is critical to financial success.

This section covers business taxes, common deductions for manufacturing businesses, sales tax management, quarterly estimated payments, tax planning strategies, and when to work with tax professionals.

**Critical Disclaimer:** Tax laws are complex, change frequently, and vary by state and situation. This section provides general educational information only. **Always consult with a qualified CPA or tax professional for advice specific to your situation.** The IRS penalties for errors, missed payments, or fraud are severe.

## 5.1 Understanding Business Taxes

### 5.1.1 Federal Income Tax

**How Your Business is Taxed Depends on Entity Structure:**

**Sole Proprietorship:**
- Report business income/loss on **Schedule C** of personal tax return (Form 1040)
- Business profit taxed at personal income tax rates (10-37% depending on income bracket)
- Pay tax on profit whether or not you withdraw money from business

**LLC (Default - Pass-Through):**
- **Single-member LLC:** Taxed as sole proprietorship (Schedule C)
- **Multi-member LLC:** Taxed as partnership (Form 1065)
  - Partnership files return but doesn't pay tax
  - Each partner receives K-1 showing their share of profit/loss
  - Partners report on personal returns and pay tax
- Profit "passes through" to owners' personal returns

**LLC Electing S-Corp Status:**
- Files corporate return (Form 1120-S)
- No corporate-level tax (pass-through)
- Owners receive K-1 for their share of profit
- Report on personal return and pay tax
- **Key difference:** Only "reasonable salary" subject to self-employment tax (see Section 5.1.3)

**C-Corporation:**
- Files corporate return (Form 1120)
- Pays corporate tax on profit (flat 21% federal rate)
- **Double taxation:** If profits distributed as dividends, shareholders pay tax again on personal returns
- Rarely used for small CNC shops due to double taxation

**2024 Federal Income Tax Brackets (Married Filing Jointly):**

| Taxable Income | Tax Rate |
|----------------|----------|
| $0 - $22,000 | 10% |
| $22,001 - $89,075 | 12% |
| $89,076 - $190,750 | 22% |
| $190,751 - $364,200 | 24% |
| $364,201 - $462,500 | 32% |
| $462,501 - $693,750 | 35% |
| Over $693,750 | 37% |

*Note: Brackets change annually. Check IRS.gov for current year.*

**Example Calculation (Sole Proprietor / LLC):**

```
Business Net Profit: $100,000
Other Income (spouse): $50,000
Total Income: $150,000
Less: Standard Deduction: $27,700 (2023)
Taxable Income: $122,300

Tax Calculation:
$22,000 × 10% = $2,200
$67,075 × 12% = $8,049
$33,225 × 22% = $7,310
Total Federal Income Tax: $17,559 (14.4% effective rate)
```

### 5.1.2 State Income Tax

**State income tax varies widely:**

**No State Income Tax (0%):**
- Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee*, Texas, Washington, Wyoming
- *Tennessee taxes interest and dividends only

**Low Tax States (<5%):**
- Arizona, Colorado, Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, etc.

**High Tax States (>7%):**
- California (up to 13.3%), Hawaii, New York, Oregon, etc.

**Your Effective Tax Rate:**
Check your state's department of revenue website for rates and rules.

**Example (Georgia - 5.75% flat rate):**
```
Taxable Income: $122,300
State Tax: $122,300 × 5.75% = $7,032
```

**Total Income Tax (Federal + State):**
$17,559 + $7,032 = $24,591 (24.6% of net profit)

### 5.1.3 Self-Employment Tax

**Self-Employment Tax = Social Security + Medicare**

**Who Pays:**
- Sole proprietors
- LLC members (default taxation)
- General partners

**Who Doesn't Pay (on all profit):**
- S-Corp owners (only on "reasonable salary" portion)
- C-Corp shareholders receiving dividends

**Rates (2024):**
- Social Security: 12.4% on first $160,200 of net earnings
- Medicare: 2.9% on all net earnings
- Additional Medicare Tax: 0.9% on earnings over $200,000 (single) / $250,000 (married)
- **Total: 15.3%** (on most earnings)

**Why So High?**
As employee, you pay 7.65% and employer pays 7.65%.
As self-employed, you're both—you pay both portions (15.3%).

**Calculation:**
```
Net Business Profit: $100,000
× 92.35% (adjustment factor) = $92,350
Social Security: $92,350 × 12.4% = $11,451
Medicare: $92,350 × 2.9% = $2,678
Total Self-Employment Tax: $14,129

Effective rate on $100K profit: 14.1%
```

**Deduction:**
You can deduct 50% of self-employment tax on your personal return (reduces income tax, not SE tax).

**Example Total Tax Burden:**
```
Net Profit: $100,000
Self-Employment Tax: $14,129
Federal Income Tax: $17,559 (from above)
State Income Tax: $7,032
TOTAL TAX: $38,720 (38.7% of profit!)
```

**This is why S-Corp election saves tax** (Section 5.5.3).

### 5.1.4 Sales Tax Collection and Remittance

**Sales Tax on Services:**

Manufacturing services are generally **exempt from sales tax** in most states (considered "manufacturing" not "services").

However, rules vary by state:
- **Some states** tax all services including machining
- **Most states** exempt manufacturing services
- **Some states** tax depending on final product use (e.g., taxable if part goes into consumer product, exempt if industrial equipment)

**Check Your State:**
Contact your state's Department of Revenue or consult with CPA.

**Sales Tax on Tangible Goods:**

If you sell tangible goods (e.g., completed parts to end users, not incorporated into customer's product), sales tax may apply.

**Example Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Contract Manufacturing (Typical CNC Shop)**
- Customer provides drawings
- You manufacture parts per spec
- Customer incorporates into their product
- **Generally: Sales tax exempt** (manufacturing service)

**Scenario 2: Selling Finished Products**
- You design and manufacture a product (e.g., custom tooling, jigs)
- Sell directly to end user
- **Generally: Sales tax applies** (sale of tangible property)

**Scenario 3: Shipping Charges**
- Sometimes taxable, sometimes not (state-specific)

**Sales Tax Registration:**

If required to collect sales tax:
1. Register with state Department of Revenue
2. Obtain sales tax permit/license (often free)
3. Charge appropriate sales tax on taxable sales
4. File returns (monthly, quarterly, or annually depending on volume)
5. Remit collected tax

**Exemption Certificates:**

Many of your customers (manufacturers) will provide **Resale Certificates** or **Exemption Certificates** claiming their purchase is tax-exempt.

- Keep certificates on file (required if audited)
- Verify certificates are complete and current
- Don't charge sales tax to exempt customers

### 5.1.5 Property Tax

**Real Property Tax:**
If you own your facility (building and land), you'll pay annual property tax to local government.
- Rate varies by location (typically 1-3% of assessed value annually)
- Paid directly to county/city
- Example: $500,000 facility × 1.5% = $7,500/year

**Personal Property Tax:**
Some states tax business personal property (equipment, furniture, inventory).
- File annual return listing assets and values
- Taxed at local rate
- Depreciated value usually used (not original cost)
- Example: $200,000 equipment × 1.2% = $2,400/year

**Check your state and county** for personal property tax requirements.

### 5.1.6 Payroll Taxes

**Once You Have Employees:**

**Federal Payroll Taxes:**
- **Social Security:** 6.2% (employer) + 6.2% (employee) = 12.4% total
- **Medicare:** 1.45% (employer) + 1.45% (employee) = 2.9% total
- **Federal Unemployment (FUTA):** 6.0% on first $7,000 per employee (credit reduces to ~0.6%)
- **Federal Income Tax Withholding:** Based on employee's W-4

**State Payroll Taxes:**
- **State Unemployment (SUTA):** Rate varies by state and experience (1-10% typical)
- **State Income Tax Withholding:** If applicable in your state

**Employer's Total Cost Example:**
```
Employee gross wages: $40,000/year

Employer taxes:
Social Security (6.2%): $2,480
Medicare (1.45%): $580
FUTA (0.6%): $42 (on $7,000)
SUTA (3%, example): $1,200
Total Employer Taxes: $4,302

Total cost to employer: $44,302 (11% above wages)
```

**Payroll Compliance:**
- Withhold and remit taxes (federal: semi-weekly or monthly; state: varies)
- File quarterly returns (Form 941 federal, state equivalents)
- File annual returns (Form 940 FUTA, W-2s, W-3)
- Penalties for late deposits or filing are severe

**Recommendation: Use Payroll Service**
- Gusto, ADP, Paychex, QuickBooks Payroll, etc.
- Cost: $30-150/month + $5-15/employee
- Handles calculations, deposits, filings, W-2s
- Worth every penny—payroll compliance is complex and risky

## 5.2 Tax Deductions for Manufacturing Businesses

**Tax deductions reduce taxable income, lowering your tax bill.**

**General Rule:** Ordinary and necessary business expenses are deductible.

### 5.2.1 Equipment Depreciation

**Depreciation:** Deducting the cost of equipment over its useful life.

**Standard Depreciation:**
- CNC equipment: 7-year recovery period (MACRS)
- Vehicles: 5-year recovery period
- Spread cost over multiple years

**Example (Standard Depreciation):**
```
CNC machine cost: $100,000
7-year MACRS depreciation schedule:
Year 1: $14,290 (14.29%)
Year 2: $24,490 (24.49%)
Year 3: $17,490 (17.49%)
Year 4: $12,490 (12.49%)
Year 5: $8,930 (8.93%)
Year 6: $8,920 (8.92%)
Year 7: $8,930 (8.93%)
Year 8: $4,460 (4.46%, half-year)
Total: $100,000
```

**Section 179 Deduction:**

**Allows immediate deduction** (first year) instead of depreciating.

**2024 Limits:**
- Maximum deduction: $1,220,000
- Phase-out threshold: $3,050,000 (if total equipment purchases exceed this, deduction phases out)

**Example (Section 179):**
```
CNC machine cost: $100,000
Elect Section 179: Deduct full $100,000 in Year 1
Tax savings (32% bracket): $32,000 in Year 1
```

**Restrictions:**
- Can't create/increase a business loss (limited to business income)
- Used equipment qualifies (great for buying used machines!)
- Must be placed in service (operational) during tax year

**Bonus Depreciation:**

**Additional immediate deduction** after Section 179.

**2024 Rate:** 60% (phasing down: was 100% through 2022, 80% in 2023)

**Example:**
```
Equipment cost: $200,000
Section 179: $100,000 (hypothetical limit for example)
Remaining: $100,000
Bonus Depreciation (60%): $60,000 (deduct Year 1)
Remaining: $40,000 (depreciate over 7 years)

Year 1 deduction: $100,000 + $60,000 + $5,716 (MACRS on $40K) = $165,716
```

**Strategy:**
- **High-profit year:** Maximize Section 179 + Bonus to reduce taxes
- **Low-profit/loss year:** Use standard depreciation to preserve deductions for future years

**Consult CPA to optimize.**

### 5.2.3 Home Office Deduction

**If you operate business from home** (e.g., home-based shop, or office in home with separate shop facility):

**Requirement: "Regular and Exclusive" Use**
- Space used regularly for business
- Used exclusively for business (not dual-purpose)
- Principal place of business OR place to meet clients

**Calculation Methods:**

**Method 1: Simplified (Easier)**
- $5 per square foot
- Maximum 300 sq ft
- Maximum deduction: $1,500

**Example:**
150 sq ft home office × $5 = $750 deduction

**Method 2: Actual Expenses (Potentially Larger)**
- Calculate percentage of home used for business
- Deduct that % of home expenses

**Example:**
```
Home office: 200 sq ft
Total home: 2,000 sq ft
Business %: 10%

Home expenses:
Mortgage interest: $15,000 × 10% = $1,500
Property taxes: $4,000 × 10% = $400
Utilities: $3,000 × 10% = $300
Insurance: $1,200 × 10% = $120
Repairs: $2,000 × 10% = $200
Total deduction: $2,520
```

**Additional:**
- Direct expenses (painting office, office repairs): 100% deductible
- Depreciation on business % of home (if you own)

**Caution:**
- Don't abuse (IRS scrutiny for excessive claims)
- Recapture depreciation if you sell home (partial)
- Not available to employees (use unreimbursed employee expense deduction instead, but severely limited after 2017 tax reform)

**Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction:**

**If self-employed (sole proprietor, partner, >2% S-Corp shareholder) and pay own health insurance:**
- Deduct premiums on personal return (Form 1040, not Schedule C)
- Deduction limited to business net profit
- Reduces income tax, not self-employment tax

**Example:**
```
Health insurance premiums: $12,000/year
Deduct on Form 1040
Tax savings (22% bracket): $2,640
```

### 5.2.4 Vehicle and Mileage

**Business Use of Vehicle:**

**Two Methods:**

**Method 1: Standard Mileage Rate (Simpler)**
- Track business miles driven
- Multiply by IRS standard rate
- 2024 rate: 67¢/mile (changes annually)

**Example:**
```
Business miles: 8,000
8,000 × $0.67 = $5,360 deduction
```

**Includes:** Gas, maintenance, insurance, depreciation (all built into rate)

**Method 2: Actual Expenses (Potentially Larger)**
- Track all vehicle expenses
- Deduct business-use percentage

**Example:**
```
Total miles: 15,000
Business miles: 10,000
Business %: 67%

Vehicle expenses:
Gas: $3,000
Insurance: $1,200
Maintenance: $800
Depreciation: $5,000
License/registration: $200
Total: $10,200

Business deduction: $10,200 × 67% = $6,834
```

**Requirements:**
- Keep mileage log (date, purpose, miles) – IRS requires contemporaneous records
- Can't switch methods once chosen (for that vehicle)
- Standard mileage only if using from first year of business use

**Commuting:**
Not deductible (home to regular place of business).

**Business Travel:**
Deductible (office to customer, between job sites, etc.)

**Vehicle Purchase:**
- If actual expense method: Depreciate (Section 179 may apply, up to limits for vehicles)
- Luxury vehicle limits apply (caps on depreciation for expensive vehicles)

### 5.2.5 Travel and Entertainment

**Business Travel:**

**Deductible (100%):**
- Airfare, train, bus
- Hotel
- Car rental
- Taxis, Uber, parking
- Baggage fees

**Meals While Traveling:**
- 50% deductible (business travel)

**Non-Deductible:**
- Personal travel

- Lavish or extravagant

**Business Meals:**

**50% deductible** if:
- Ordinary and necessary
- Not lavish or extravagant
- You or employee present
- Business conducted (or directly related to business)

**Examples:**
- Meal with customer discussing project: 50% deductible
- Meal with supplier negotiating terms: 50% deductible
- Employee meals while traveling: 50% deductible
- Lunch while working alone: NOT deductible (personal)

**Exception: 100% Deductible:**
- Company parties or picnics (all employees invited)
- Meals provided for employer convenience (e.g., working through lunch on rush job)
- Meals at conferences (if separately stated, sometimes 50%)

**Entertainment:**

**NOT deductible** (as of 2018 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act):
- Tickets to sporting events, concerts
- Golf outings
- Entertainment events

Even if business discussed, pure entertainment expenses are not deductible.

**Record-Keeping:**
- Keep receipts
- Note purpose, attendees, business discussed
- IRS requires substantiation

## 5.3 Quarterly Estimated Tax Payments

**Why Quarterly Payments:**

The U.S. tax system is "pay-as-you-go." Employees have taxes withheld from paychecks. Self-employed/business owners must pay estimated taxes quarterly.

**Who Must Pay:**
- Expect to owe >$1,000 in tax (after withholding and credits)

**Penalty for Not Paying:**
- Underpayment penalty + interest (currently ~8% annually)

**Payment Schedule:**

| Quarter | Period Covered | Due Date |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| Q1 | Jan 1 - Mar 31 | April 15 |
| Q2 | Apr 1 - May 31 | June 15 |
| Q3 | Jun 1 - Aug 31 | September 15 |
| Q4 | Sep 1 - Dec 31 | January 15 (next year) |

**Calculating Estimated Taxes:**

**Method 1: Estimate Current Year**
- Project annual income
- Calculate estimated tax
- Divide by 4, pay quarterly

**Example:**
```
Projected net profit: $100,000
Estimated self-employment tax: $14,130
Estimated income tax (federal + state): $25,000
Total estimated tax: $39,130
Quarterly payment: $39,130 ÷ 4 = $9,783
```

**Method 2: Safe Harbor (Avoids Penalty)**

Pay the **lesser of**:
- 90% of current year tax
- 100% of prior year tax (110% if AGI >$150,000)

**Example:**
```
Prior year tax: $30,000
Safe harbor: Pay $30,000 (in 4 quarterly installments)
Even if current year tax is $40,000, no penalty (pay difference when filing)
```

**How to Pay:**
- IRS: Form 1040-ES (voucher and check, or pay online at IRS.gov)
- State: Varies (online payment portals)

**Pro Tip:**
Many business owners overpay slightly to avoid penalty and get refund when filing.

## 5.4 Sales Tax Management

### 5.4.1 Nexus and Multi-State Sales

**Nexus:** Connection to a state that creates tax obligation.

**Physical Nexus:**
- Facility, office, warehouse in state
- Employees in state
- Inventory in state

**Economic Nexus (Post-Wayfair Decision):**
- Revenue or transaction thresholds in state (typically $100,000 revenue or 200 transactions)
- Even without physical presence, may create obligation

**Multi-State Considerations:**

If selling to customers in multiple states:
- May need to register and collect sales tax in each state where you have nexus
- Complex compliance (each state has different rates, rules, filing frequencies)
- Consider sales tax software (Avalara, TaxJar, etc.) if significant multi-state sales

**Most CNC Job Shops:**
- Primarily local/regional customers
- Manufacturing services often exempt
- Multi-state sales tax usually not major issue

**But if shipping products nationally:**
Consult with CPA and consider sales tax software.

### 5.4.2 Resale Certificates

**Resale Certificate (or Exemption Certificate):**
Document provided by customer claiming exemption from sales tax.

**Common Reasons:**
- Purchasing for resale (will charge sales tax to their customer)
- Manufacturing exemption (incorporating into their product)
- Direct pay permit (customer remits tax directly to state)

**Your Responsibility:**
- Collect certificate before exempting sale
- Verify certificate is complete (all fields filled in)
- Keep on file (required if audited)
- Update periodically (many states require renewal every 3-5 years)

**Incomplete/Missing Certificate:**
If audited and you can't produce valid certificate, you're liable for the tax you should have collected.

### 5.4.3 Manufacturing Exemptions

Many states exempt:
- Machinery and equipment used directly in manufacturing
- Raw materials and supplies consumed in manufacturing
- Utilities used in production

**Examples:**
- Buying CNC machine: May be sales tax exempt (manufacturing equipment exemption)
- Buying raw materials (aluminum, steel): May be exempt
- Electricity for machines: May be partially exempt (production vs. office use)

**Varies by State:**
Check your state's manufacturing exemption rules and obtain proper exemption certificates.

**Potential Savings:**
```
$100,000 equipment purchase
Sales tax (8%): $8,000
With manufacturing exemption: $0
Savings: $8,000
```

## 5.5 Tax Planning Strategies

### 5.5.1 Timing Income and Expenses

**Accrual vs. Cash Basis Tax Reporting:**

Even if using accrual accounting for financial statements, many small businesses use cash basis for tax (if eligible).

**Cash Basis Tax Advantages:**
- Control timing of income and deductions
- Defer income to next year (delay billing/receiving payment in December → income in January)
- Accelerate expenses into current year (pay January bills in December)

**Example (High-Profit Year):**
- It's December, expecting $120,000 profit
- Accelerate expenses:
  - Prepay rent for January-March: $7,500
  - Order and pay for materials now (delivered in January): $15,000
  - Pay annual insurance premium in December instead of January: $9,000
  - Purchase small tools/supplies: $3,000
  - Total accelerated: $34,500
- Reduces current year taxable income: $120,000 → $85,500
- Tax savings (32% bracket): $11,040

**Defer income:**
- Don't invoice in late December (invoice in January)
- Delay cash collections if possible

**Opposite Strategy (Low-Profit Year):**
- Defer expenses to next year
- Accelerate income into current year
- Use deductions when they'll save more tax

**Consult CPA in Q4:**
Review year-to-date financials and plan year-end moves.

### 5.5.2 Retirement Plan Contributions

**Retirement Plans = Tax Deductions:**

Contributing to retirement plans reduces taxable income.

**Options for Self-Employed:**

**1. SEP IRA (Simplified Employee Pension)**
- Contribution limit: 25% of compensation, up to $66,000 (2024)
- Easy to set up and administer
- Employer contributions only (you)
- Must contribute same % for eligible employees (if any)

**Example:**
```
Net profit: $100,000
Contribution: $25,000 (25%)
Reduces taxable income: $100,000 → $75,000
Tax savings (32%): $8,000
```

**2. Solo 401(k)**
- Higher contribution potential: $66,000 (2024) or $73,500 if age 50+
- Employee deferral ($22,500 / $30,000 if 50+) + employer contribution (up to 25%)
- More complex administration
- Only if no employees (except spouse)

**Example:**
```
Net profit: $120,000
Employee deferral: $22,500
Employer contribution: $25,000
Total contribution: $47,500
Tax savings (32%): $15,200
```

**3. SIMPLE IRA**
- For businesses with <100 employees
- Employee deferrals up to $15,500 (2024)
- Employer match required (3%) or 2% nonelective
- Lower limits than SEP or Solo 401(k)

**Strategy:**
- **High-profit years:** Max out retirement contributions (reduce tax)
- Builds retirement savings while saving current tax
- Funds grow tax-deferred

**Deadline:**
- SEP IRA: Tax return deadline (including extensions) - can set up and fund after year-end
- Solo 401(k): Establish by Dec 31, contribute by tax deadline

### 5.5.3 Entity Structure Optimization

**LLC vs. S-Corp Tax Savings:**

**LLC (Default Taxation):**
```
Net profit: $100,000
Self-employment tax (15.3%): $14,130
Income tax (25% effective): $25,000
Total tax: $39,130
```

**LLC Electing S-Corp:**
```
Net profit: $100,000
Reasonable salary: $50,000
  FICA taxes (7.65% employee + 7.65% employer): $7,650
Distribution: $50,000
  No self-employment tax

Total self-employment/payroll tax: $7,650
Income tax (same): $25,000
Total tax: $32,650

Savings: $6,480/year
```

**Minus:** S-Corp compliance costs (payroll processing, additional accounting): $2,000-3,000/year

**Net savings: $3,500-4,500/year**

**When It Makes Sense:**
- Net profit >$60,000-80,000 (break-even point where savings exceed added costs)
- Stable, predictable income
- Willing to handle payroll compliance

**Caution: "Reasonable Salary"**
IRS requires you pay yourself a reasonable salary (not artificially low to avoid taxes).

**Reasonable Salary Guidelines:**
- What would you pay someone with your skills/responsibilities?
- Industry standards: $40,000-80,000 for owner/operator machinist
- IRS audits suspiciously low salaries

**Don't:**
```
Net profit: $100,000
Salary: $10,000 (too low, IRS red flag)
Distribution: $90,000

## 5.6 Record Keeping and Audit Preparation

**IRS Audit Rate:**
- Small businesses: ~1% (relatively low but not zero)
- Certain triggers increase likelihood (large deductions, consistent losses, cash-intensive businesses, major red flags)

**Statute of Limitations:**
- Generally 3 years (IRS can audit 3 prior years)
- If substantial underreporting (>25%): 6 years
- Fraud: No limit

**Record Retention:**
Keep records for at least **7 years** (safe; covers extended statute).

**Records to Maintain:**

**Financial:**
- Bank statements
- Credit card statements
- Invoices (sent and received)
- Receipts for expenses
- Payroll records
- Tax returns
- Financial statements

**Supporting Documentation:**
- Contracts
- Loan documents
- Asset purchase records (for depreciation)
- Mileage logs (contemporaneous, detailed)
- Travel expenses (receipts, business purpose)
- Meal expenses (receipts, attendees, purpose)

**Audit Preparation:**

**If Selected for Audit:**
1. Don't panic (doesn't mean you did something wrong)
2. Contact your CPA immediately (let them handle)
3. Provide requested documentation only (don't volunteer extra)
4. Be professional and cooperative
5. Let CPA negotiate

**Best Defense:**
- Good record-keeping
- Reasonable deductions
- Accurate reporting
- Professional CPA representation

## 5.7 Working with Tax Professionals

**DIY vs. Professional:**

**Very Small Businesses (<$50K revenue, simple):**
- May handle own taxes with software (TurboTax, H&R Block, etc.)
- Risk: Miss deductions, errors, compliance issues

**Most CNC Shops:**
- **Use a CPA (Certified Public Accountant)**
- Expertise worth the cost
- Saves tax (deductions you'd miss often exceed CPA fee)
- Reduces risk and stress

**What CPA Provides:**

**Tax Preparation:**
- Business returns (1120-S, 1065, etc.)
- Personal returns (1040)
- State and local returns
- Extensions if needed

**Tax Planning:**
- Quarterly check-ins
- Year-end planning
- Entity structure optimization
- Retirement planning
- Estimated tax calculations

**Representation:**
- IRS audits or notices
- State tax issues
- Correspondence and negotiation

**Strategic Advice:**
- Financial decision support
- Business structure questions
- Major purchase timing (tax implications)

**Cost:**
- Tax preparation: $500-2,000 for small business (depends on complexity)
- Ongoing advisory: $150-400/hour or monthly retainer
- Worth it for peace of mind and tax savings

**Selecting a CPA:**

**Look For:**
- Small business/manufacturing experience
- Proactive (reaches out with ideas, not just reactive)
- Responsive and available
- Clear communication (explains in plain English)
- Technology-savvy (e-filing, online collaboration)
- Local or virtual (doesn't have to be local anymore)

**Red Flags:**
- Promises unrealistic refunds or "secret deductions"
- Aggressive strategies (if sounds too good to be true...)
- Unresponsive
- Unexplained fees
- Errors or missed deadlines

**Questions to Ask:**
- Experience with manufacturing/small businesses?
- Who will prepare my return? (CPA or staff?)
- What's included in fee? (preparation only or advisory too?)
- Availability for questions throughout year?
- Audit support included or additional?

**Build Relationship:**
- Meet quarterly (at minimum)
- Share financial statements and business developments
- Ask questions (no such thing as a dumb tax question)
- Follow their advice
