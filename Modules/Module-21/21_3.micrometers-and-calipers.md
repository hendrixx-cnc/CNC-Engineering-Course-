# Module 21 – Metrology and Precision Measurement


## 21.3.1 Micrometers and Calipers

### Micrometers

The micrometer is one of the most fundamental precision measurement tools in machining.

**Types of Micrometers**:
- **Outside Micrometer**: Measures external dimensions
- **Inside Micrometer**: Measures internal dimensions (bores, slots)
- **Depth Micrometer**: Measures depth of holes, slots, recesses
- **Thread Micrometer**: Measures thread pitch diameter
- **Blade Micrometer**: Thin anvils for narrow slots and grooves

**Resolution**:
- Standard: 0.001" (0.01mm)
- Vernier: 0.0001" (0.002mm)
- Digital: 0.00005" (0.001mm)

**Reading a Micrometer**:

1. **Sleeve**: Marked in 0.025" increments (imperial) or 0.5mm (metric)
2. **Thimble**: 25 divisions (imperial) or 50 divisions (metric)
3. **Vernier** (if equipped): Adds additional decimal place

**Proper Micrometer Technique**:

- Use ratchet stop or friction thimble for consistent pressure
- Measure at multiple points and average
- Clean measuring faces before use
- Allow thermal stabilization
- Check zero reading before use
- Store in protective case

**Common Errors**:
- **Parallax error**: Reading scale at an angle
- **Excessive force**: Deforming part or instrument
- **Dirt on anvils**: False high readings
- **Temperature difference**: Between part and standard

### Calipers

Calipers are versatile instruments for measuring external, internal, and depth dimensions.

**Types**:
- **Vernier Caliper**: Mechanical, 0.001" resolution
- **Dial Caliper**: Mechanical with dial indicator, 0.001" resolution
- **Digital Caliper**: Electronic display, 0.0005" resolution

**Measurement Capabilities**:
- Outside jaws: External dimensions
- Inside jaws: Internal dimensions (bores, slots)
- Depth rod: Depth measurements
- Step measurement: Using both beams

**Proper Caliper Technique**:

- Close jaws with light, consistent pressure
- Ensure jaws are perpendicular to surface
- For inside measurements, rock caliper to find maximum dimension
- Clean jaws and surfaces before measuring
- Avoid using excessive force
- Check zero before use

**Limitations**:
- Less accurate than micrometers
- Prone to misalignment
- Easier to damage
- Battery drain in digital models

**Best Practices**:
- Use micrometers for critical dimensions
- Use calipers for quick checks and non-critical features
- Verify critical measurements with multiple instruments
