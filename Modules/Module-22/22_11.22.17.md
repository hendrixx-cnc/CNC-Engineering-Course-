## Section 22.11 – Customer Focus and Satisfaction

### Understanding Customer Requirements

**Customer Focus**: Core principle of ISO 9001 - understanding and meeting customer needs drives quality

**Methods to Understand Requirements**:
- **Contract Review**: Detailed review of purchase orders, specifications, drawings before acceptance
- **Customer Meetings**: Discuss expectations, priorities, critical characteristics
- **Customer Specifications**: Study customer-specific requirements (CSRs), quality manuals
- **Industry Standards**: Understand applicable standards (aerospace AS9100, medical ISO 13485)

**Contract Review Process**:
1. Review PO/contract for completeness
2. Verify specifications, drawings current revision
3. Confirm capabilities (can we make it?)
4. Check material availability
5. Validate delivery schedule feasible
6. Identify special requirements (certifications, testing, FAI)
7. Approve or request clarification before accepting

### Customer Communication and Order Review

**Effective Communication Channels**:
- Email, phone, customer portals
- Regular status updates on orders
- Proactive notification of issues or delays
- Technical questions resolved promptly

**Order Review Documentation**: Document acceptance of customer requirements (signed quote, order acknowledgment)

### Customer Feedback and Complaint Handling

**Customer Complaint Process**:
1. **Receive**: Log complaint immediately
2. **Acknowledge**: Respond within 24 hours
3. **Investigate**: Determine cause (NCR, root cause analysis)
4. **Containment**: Sort inventory, notify if more product affected
5. **Response**: Provide corrective action plan to customer
6. **Corrective Action**: Implement to prevent recurrence
7. **Follow-up**: Verify customer satisfied with resolution

**Complaint Documentation**: Customer Complaint Form capturing issue, investigation, actions, closure

### Customer Satisfaction Surveys

**Survey Design**:
- Rate key areas: quality, delivery, communication, responsiveness, value
- 1-5 scale or NPS (Net Promoter Score)
- Open-ended questions for improvement suggestions

**Survey Example Questions**:
- Rate product quality (conformance to specifications)
- Rate on-time delivery performance
- Rate responsiveness to inquiries and issues
- Rate overall satisfaction
- Would you recommend us to others?
- What can we improve?

**Survey Timing**: Annually or after major projects

**Survey Results**: Analyze, share in management review, develop action plans for low scores

### On-Time Delivery Performance

**Tracking OTD**:
```
OTD % = (Orders Delivered On-Time / Total Orders) × 100
```

**Target**: ≥95% (AS9100 requires monitoring)

**Improvement Actions**:
- Accurate quoting (realistic lead times)
- Production scheduling optimization
- Supplier delivery improvements

- **Metrics**: Track improvements (ROI, quality gains)

**Improvement Sources**:
- Corrective actions (CARs)
- Audit findings
- Employee suggestions
- Customer feedback
- Benchmarking

### Lean Manufacturing Principles

**Lean**: Systematic approach to eliminating waste and maximizing value

**8 Wastes** (DOWNTIME):
- **D**efects (scrap, rework)
- **O**verproduction (making more than needed)
- **W**aiting (idle time)
- **N**on-utilized talent (employee skills not used)
- **T**ransportation (unnecessary movement of materials)
- **I**nventory (excess stock)
- **M**otion (unnecessary operator movement)
- **E**xtra processing (work not adding value)

#### Value Stream Mapping

**Value Stream Map (VSM)**: Visual representation of material and information flow from supplier to customer

**VSM Process**:
1. **Current State Map**: Document existing process (cycle times, inventory, lead times)
2. **Identify Waste**: Highlight non-value-added activities
3. **Future State Map**: Design improved process (reduced waste, faster flow)
4. **Implementation Plan**: Actions to achieve future state

**VSM Benefits**: Identifies bottlenecks, excess inventory, long lead times

#### 5S Workplace Organization

**5S**: Structured approach to workplace organization

**5S Steps**:
1. **Sort** (Seiri): Remove unnecessary items
2. **Set in Order** (Seiton): Organize remaining items (tools, materials) for easy access
3. **Shine** (Seiso): Clean workspace thoroughly
4. **Standardize** (Seiketsu): Establish standards for cleanliness and organization
5. **Sustain** (Shitsuke): Maintain standards (audits, discipline)

**5S Benefits**: Reduces search time, improves safety, enhances quality (clean environment reduces contamination)

**5S Example**:
- **Before**: Tools scattered on workbench, hard to find, some missing
- **After**: Shadow board with tool outlines, each tool has designated spot, missing tools immediately visible

#### Kaizen Events

**Kaizen**: Japanese term meaning "continuous improvement" or "change for better"

**Kaizen Event**: Focused improvement project (typically 3-5 days) targeting specific problem

**Kaizen Event Process**:
1. **Select Topic**: Identify improvement opportunity (reduce setup time, improve quality, eliminate waste)
2. **Form Team**: Cross-functional (operations, engineering, quality, maintenance)
3. **Current State Analysis**: Document existing process, metrics
4. **Generate Ideas**: Brainstorm improvements
5. **Implement**: Make changes during event (quick prototyping, try ideas)
6. **Measure Results**: Compare before/after metrics
7. **Standardize**: Document new process, train personnel
8. **Sustain**: Monitor to ensure improvements maintained

**Kaizen Example**: Reduce CNC setup time from 60 minutes to 30 minutes
- Analyze setup process, identify delays (tool selection, work offset entry, part loading)
- Implement SMED techniques (see below)
- Result: 50% reduction in setup time, increased capacity

#### Single Minute Exchange of Dies (SMED)

**SMED**: Methodology to reduce setup/changeover time (goal: <10 minutes, "single minute")

**SMED Techniques**:
- **External Setup**: Perform activities while machine running (prepare tools, fixtures, programs before stopping machine)
- **Internal Setup**: Minimize activities requiring machine stopped
- **Standardize**: Use standardized tooling, fixtures (reduce adjustment time)
- **Quick-change devices**: Fast clamps, quick-change tool holders
- **Eliminate adjustments**: Preset tools, fixed work offsets

**SMED Example**:
- **Before**: 60-minute setup (find tools 10 min, install tooling 20 min, adjust offsets 15 min, first-off inspection 15 min)
- **After**: 25-minute setup (tools pre-staged, quick-change tool holders, preset offsets, first-off inspection unchanged)

### Six Sigma Methodology

**Six Sigma**: Data-driven methodology for reducing variation and defects

**Six Sigma Goal**: Achieve 3.4 defects per million opportunities (Cpk = 2.0)

**DMAIC Process**: Five-phase problem-solving approach

1. **Define**: Define problem, customer requirements, project goals
2. **Measure**: Measure current performance (baseline data, Cpk)
3. **Analyze**: Analyze data to identify root causes (statistical analysis, hypothesis testing)
4. **Improve**: Implement solutions to eliminate root causes
5. **Control**: Establish controls to sustain improvements (SPC, procedures, training)

**Six Sigma Belts**: Certification levels
- **Yellow Belt**: Basic tools, support projects
- **Green Belt**: Lead projects part-time
- **Black Belt**: Lead projects full-time, coach Green Belts
- **Master Black Belt**: Train Black Belts, strategic deployment

**Six Sigma Tools**: Statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, DOE (Design of Experiments), control charts

### Total Productive Maintenance (TPM)

**TPM**: Proactive maintenance approach maximizing equipment effectiveness

**TPM Pillars**:
1. **Autonomous Maintenance**: Operators perform routine maintenance (cleaning, lubrication, inspections)
2. **Planned Maintenance**: Scheduled preventive maintenance
3. **Quality Maintenance**: Prevent defects through equipment maintenance
4. **Focused Improvement**: Eliminate losses (breakdowns, defects, reduced speed)
5. **Early Equipment Management**: Design maintainability into new equipment
6. **Training**: Develop operator and maintenance skills
7. **Safety, Health, Environment**: Clean, safe workplace
8. **TPM in Administration**: Apply TPM principles to office processes

**OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness)**:
```
OEE = Availability × Performance × Quality

Availability = Actual Run Time / Planned Production Time
Performance = Actual Output / Theoretical Max Output
Quality = Good Parts / Total Parts Produced
```

**OEE World-Class Target**: 85%

**Example**: OEE = 90% availability × 95% performance × 98% quality = 84% (near world-class)

### Employee Suggestion Systems

**Suggestion Program**: Structured process for employees to submit improvement ideas

**Program Elements**:
- **Submission**: Simple form (paper or electronic)
- **Review**: Management reviews suggestions promptly
- **Implementation**: Approved ideas implemented
- **Recognition**: Rewards (monetary, non-monetary, recognition)
- **Feedback**: Thank submitters, explain decisions

**Best Practices**:
- Respond quickly (within 2 weeks)
- Implement easy wins immediately (builds momentum)
- Recognize participation even if idea not implemented
- Share successes (bulletin board, meetings)

## Section 22.13 – Traceability and Record Retention

### Material Traceability Systems

**Traceability**: Ability to trace material and process history of part

**Why Traceability Critical**:
- **Recalls**: Identify affected parts if defect discovered
- **Root Cause Investigation**: Trace problems to specific material lot or process
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Required for aerospace, medical, automotive
- **Customer Requirement**: Often specified in contract

**Traceability Levels**:
1. **Lot/Batch Traceability**: Group of parts from same material lot, production run
2. **Serial Number Traceability**: Individual part tracked (highest level)

### Lot and Serial Number Tracking

**Lot Number**: Identifier for group of parts (Date code, work order number, production lot)

**Example Lot Number**: LOT-2024-0515 (year-month-day)

**Serial Number**: Unique identifier for individual part

**Example Serial Number**: SN-123456 (sequential numbering)

**When Serial Numbers Required**:
- Aerospace critical parts (engines, flight controls)
- Medical implants
- High-value parts
- Customer requirement

**Marking Methods**:
- Laser etching (permanent, clean)
- Dot peen (permanent, readable)
- Stamping (permanent, may distort part)
- Labels (temporary, for non-critical parts)

### Work Order and Traveler Systems

**Traveler (Router)**: Document that follows part through manufacturing, recording operations and inspections

**Traveler Contents**:
- Part number, quantity, lot/serial numbers
- Operations performed (with operator signature, date)
- Inspection results (first-off, in-process, final)
- Material information (heat lot)
- Process certifications (heat treatment, plating)
- Nonconformances (NCRs, dispositions)

**Traveler as Traceability Record**: Links part to all manufacturing history

### Electronic Record Keeping (ERP/MES Integration)

**ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)**: Business software managing operations (orders, inventory, purchasing, accounting)

**MES (Manufacturing Execution System)**: Software managing shop floor operations (work orders, scheduling, tracking, data collection)

**Electronic Traceability Benefits**:
- Real-time visibility (where parts are, status)
- Automatic data capture (barcode scanning, machine integration)
- Rapid queries ("Which jobs used heat lot H-123?")
- Reduced paperwork
- Improved accuracy

**Electronic Traveler**: Digital version eliminating paper

### Record Retention Requirements by Industry

## Section 22.14 – Measurement Systems Analysis (MSA)

**MSA** covered in detail in Section 22.3.3.3 (IATF 16949 - Automotive standards). Key concepts summarized here for general application.

### MSA Purpose and Applications

**Purpose**: Quantify measurement system variation to ensure data reliability

**Applications**:
- Validate gages before use (Gage R&R studies)
- Troubleshoot measurement problems (high variation, inconsistent results)
- Continuous improvement (reduce measurement variation)
- Customer requirement (PPAP, process validation)

### Gage Repeatability and Reproducibility (Gage R&R)

**Gage R&R Study**: Most common MSA method

**Components**:
- **Repeatability**: Equipment variation (same operator, same part, multiple measurements)
- **Reproducibility**: Operator variation (different operators, same part)

**Study Design**:
- 10 parts (spanning process range)
- 3 operators
- 3 trials each (10 × 3 × 3 = 90 measurements)

**Analysis** (software typically used: Minitab):
- Calculate % Gage R&R = (Gage R&R / Total Variation) × 100

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **<10%**: Excellent (acceptable)
- **10-30%**: Marginal (may be acceptable depending on application)
- **>30%**: Unacceptable (improve measurement system)

**Improvement Actions**:
- **High Repeatability** (equipment): Better gage, calibration, fixture, environmental control
- **High Reproducibility** (operators): Training, procedure clarification, automation

### Bias and Linearity Studies

**Bias**: Difference between observed average and true value (accuracy)

**Bias Study**: Measure reference standard multiple times, compare to known value

**Linearity**: Bias consistent across measurement range?

**Linearity Study**: Measure reference standards at low, medium, high values; check if bias changes

### Attribute Agreement Analysis

**Attribute Gage**: Go/no-go, pass/fail (not continuous measurement)

**Attribute Agreement Analysis**: Assess operator agreement

**Metrics**:
- Agreement with standard (% correct)
- Agreement among operators (Kappa statistic)

**Improvement**: Training, clearer acceptance criteria, objective gaging

### MSA Acceptance Criteria

**Decision**: Gage R&R <10% → Use gage confidently

**10-30%**: Use with caution, consider application criticality

**>30%**: Do not use; improve measurement system

### Improving Measurement System Performance

**Strategies**:
- Upgrade gages (higher resolution, better accuracy)
- Improve fixturing (consistent part location)
- Environmental control (temperature, vibration)
- Standardize technique (procedures, training)
- Automate (CMM, vision systems)

- **Purpose**: Review QMS documentation (quality manual, procedures)
- **Location**: Can be remote (document review) or on-site
- **Duration**: 1 day typical (small organization)
- **Outcome**: Identify documentation gaps; must fix before Stage 2

**Stage 2 Audit (Implementation Audit)**:
- **Purpose**: Verify QMS implemented and effective (on-site audit)
- **Duration**: 2-5 days depending on organization size, scope, complexity
- **Process**: Similar to internal audit (interviews, observations, record review)
- **Outcome**: Certification recommended (if conforming) or nonconformances to address

### Addressing Non-Conformances

**If Nonconformances Found**:
- **Major NC**: Prevent certification; must correct and verify before certificate issued
- **Minor NC**: Certificate issued conditionally; must correct within 90 days

**Corrective Action**:
- Investigate root cause
- Implement corrective action
- Provide evidence to registrar
- Registrar verifies (document review or follow-up visit)

**Timeline**: Correct nonconformances within 90 days; if not, re-audit required (additional cost)

### Maintaining Certification (Surveillance Audits)

**Certification Cycle**: 3 years

**Surveillance Audits**: Annual audits (Years 1 and 2 of cycle) to verify continued compliance

**Surveillance Audit**:
- **Duration**: Shorter than Stage 2 (1-2 days)
- **Scope**: Sample of processes (not entire QMS each visit)
- **Outcome**: Certificate maintained (if conforming) or nonconformances to correct

**Recertification Audit** (Year 3): Full audit similar to Stage 2; new 3-year certificate issued if passed

**Maintaining Certification**:
- Keep QMS updated (procedures, training, records)
- Conduct internal audits
- Address nonconformances promptly
- Management review regularly
- Notify registrar of major changes (ownership, scope, locations)

### Recertification Process

**Recertification Audit** (every 3 years): Comprehensive audit renewing certificate

**Process**: Similar to initial Stage 2 audit (full QMS review)

**Preparation**: Internal audits, management review, verify all corrective actions closed

### Multiple Site Certification

**Multi-Site Certification**: Single certificate covering multiple locations

**Requirements**:
- Centralized management system
- Similar processes at sites
- Registrar audits sample of sites (not all every audit)

**Benefits**: Cost savings (fewer audit days), single certificate

### Lessons Learned and Best Practices

**Lessons from Successful Implementations**:

1. **Start Simple**: Don't over-document; build procedures that people will actually use
2. **Involve Employees**: People support what they help create; involve shop floor in writing work instructions
3. **Leverage Existing Systems**: If you have informal processes that work, formalize them (don't reinvent)
4. **Focus on Value**: QMS should improve operations, not just create paperwork
5. **Leadership Visible**: Management participation demonstrates importance
6. **Celebrate Wins**: Recognize milestones (first internal audit complete, certification achieved)
7. **Continuous Improvement**: QMS never "done"; keep improving

**Best Practices**:
- Benchmark: Visit other certified shops, learn from their experience
- Phased Approach: Implement in stages (core procedures first, advanced later)
- Use Technology: Document management software, electronic forms reduce burden
- Training Critical: Invest time in training; people can't follow procedures they don't understand
- External Help: Consultant accelerates implementation, provides expertise
- Realistic Timeline: Don't rush; quality implementation takes time
