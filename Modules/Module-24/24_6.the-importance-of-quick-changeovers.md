# Module 24 – L.E.A.N. Strategies for CNC Manufacturing


## 24.6.1 The Importance of Quick Changeovers

**Setup time (changeover time)** is one of the biggest barriers to Lean manufacturing.

### The Setup Time Problem

**Traditional Thinking:**
- Long setups are "necessary"
- Run large batches to "absorb" setup cost
- Result: Excess inventory, long lead times, inflexibility

**Example:**
- Setup time: 2 hours (120 minutes)
- Run time: 1 minute/part
- Economic batch: 200+ parts (to make setup % small)
- Lead time: Days or weeks of WIP

**Problems from Long Setups:**

**1. Large Batch Sizes**
- Must run many parts to justify setup
- Creates WIP inventory
- Long lead times

**2. Inflexibility**
- Can't respond quickly to demand changes
- Committed to large batches
- Mix flexibility limited

**3. Quality Issues**
- Large batch means many defects before detection
- Setup errors affect entire batch
- Scrap costs multiplied

**4. Schedule Complexity**
- Minimize setups by batching
- Complex scheduling logic
- Late orders wait for batch completion

### The SMED Revolution

**SMED: Single Minute Exchange of Dies**

**Goal:** Reduce setup time to single digits (< 10 minutes)

**Not literally "one minute"** but less than 10 minutes (single-digit minutes).

**Developed by Shigeo Shingo** at Toyota in 1950s-1970s.

**SMED Benefits:**

**1. Small Batch Capability**
- Setup time negligible vs. run time
- Economic to run one piece
- Enables one-piece flow

**2. Flexibility**
- Quick response to demand changes
- Mix model scheduling
- Competitive advantage

**3. Reduced Inventory**
- No need for large batches
- Lower WIP
- Cash freed up

**4. Shorter Lead Times**
- Small batches flow faster
- Customer satisfaction

**5. Better Quality**
- Small batches = quick feedback
- Setup errors caught early
- Less scrap risk

**Example SMED Impact:**

**Before:**
- Setup: 120 minutes
- Batch: 200 parts
- Setups/day: 1 (max)
- WIP: 1,000+ parts
- Lead time: 10 days

**After SMED:**
- Setup: 9 minutes (93% reduction!)
- Batch: 20 parts
- Setups/day: 10+ possible
- WIP: 100 parts
- Lead time: 1 day

## 24.6.2 SMED Methodology

**Three-Step Process for Setup Reduction**

### 24.6.2.1 Separate Internal and External Setup

**Internal Setup:** Activities that MUST be done while machine is stopped.

**Examples:**
- Remove old fixture, install new fixture
- Adjust tool positions
- Load first part
- Make first part, inspect

**External Setup:** Activities that CAN be done while machine is running.

**Examples:**
- Get tools, fixtures, programs
- Pre-set tool lengths
- Gather materials
- Stage next job

**Key Insight:**
**30-50% of "setup time" is actually external work done while machine is idle!**

**Step 1: Identify What's Internal vs. External**

**Current state:** Everything done after machine stops.

**Example Traditional Setup:**
1. Stop machine (last part of previous job)
2. Walk to tool crib, get fixtures (5 min)
3. Walk to office, get program (3 min)
4. Remove old fixture (10 min)
5. Find new fixture (wasn't staged) (5 min)
6. Install new fixture (15 min)
7. Load program (2 min)
8. Find tools (3 min)
9. Adjust tool positions (20 min)
10. Run first part (5 min)
11. Inspect, adjust (15 min)
12. Run good part

**Total: 83 minutes (all internal)**

**Separate Internal/External:**

**External (Do BEFORE machine stops):**
- Get fixtures (5 min)
- Get program (3 min)
- Stage tools (3 min)
- Pre-set tools (can be done offline)

**Internal (MUST do while stopped):**
- Remove old fixture (10 min)
- Install new fixture (15 min)
- Load program (2 min)
- Adjust tool positions (20 min)
- First part/inspect (20 min)

**New Internal Time: 67 minutes** (16 min saved just by separating!)

### 24.6.2.2 Convert Internal to External

**Goal:** Move as much internal work as possible to external.

**Strategies:**

**1. Standardize Components**
- Standard fixture base (quick-change top plate)
- Standard tool holders
- Standard collets
- Reduces adjustment time

**2. Pre-Setting**
- Pre-set tool lengths offline
- Pre-heat dies/fixtures
- Pre-load programs
- Pre-position adjustments

**3. Parallel Operations**
- Two operators work simultaneously
- One inside machine, one outside
- Team setup vs. individual

**4. Function Clamps**
- Quick-clamp systems replace bolts
- Toggle clamps, cam locks
- One motion vs. multiple turns

**5. Eliminate Adjustments**
- Fixed positions (repeatability)
- Hard stops, locating pins
- Eliminate trial-and-error

**Example Conversion:**

**Internal to External:**
- Tool pre-setting: 20 min internal → 0 min internal (done offline before)
- Program loading: Use USB drive staged at machine (no walking)

**Internal Simplified:**
- Quick-change fixture base: 15 min → 3 min
- Adjustments eliminated (preset): 20 min → 2 min (verify only)

**New Internal Time: 35 minutes** (67 → 35, another 32 min saved!)

### 24.6.2.3 Streamline All Setup Activities

**Refine both internal and external to be faster.**

**Internal Streamlining:**

**1. Organize Work**
- Sequence for efficiency
- Minimize movement
- Batch similar tasks

**2. Improve Methods**
- Better tools (power vs. manual)
- Ergonomic positioning
- Two-hand economy

**3. Visual Aids**
- Color coding
- Directional arrows
- Instruction photos at machine

**4. Standard Work**
- Document best method
- Train everyone the same
- Continuous improvement platform

**External Streamlining:**

**1. Kitting**
- All tools/fixtures/programs in one kit
- Staged at machine before changeover
- No searching

**2. Point-of-Use Storage**
- Fixtures stored at machine
- Tools in shadow board
- Programs on USB at machine

**3. Visual Management**
- Labeled locations
- Shadow boards
- Checklists

**Example Final State:**

**Streamlined Setup (All Steps):**

**External (Before Stop):**
- Kit staged: fixtures, tools, program (2 min prep)

**Internal (Machine Stopped):**
1. Remove old fixture (quick-change): 1 min
2. Install new fixture (quick-change): 1 min
3. Load program (USB at machine): 0.5 min
4. Install pre-set tools: 1 min
5. Run first part (pre-set, no adjustment): 3 min
6. Quick verify (should be good): 1 min

**Total Internal: 7.5 minutes** (83 → 7.5 min = **91% reduction!**)

**SMED achieved:** Single-digit setup time!

## 24.6.3 Setup Time Analysis

**Before improving, you must understand current state.**

### 24.6.3.1 Current State Documentation

**Select Representative Setup:**
- Common product change
- Typical, not easiest or hardest
- Perform actual setup (not from memory)

**Data to Collect:**
- Total setup time (start to finish)
- Each step (description, duration)
- Who performs (number of people)
- Tools/equipment used
- Problems encountered

**Setup Time Definition:**

**Start:** Last good part of previous job

**End:** First good part of new job

**Include ALL time:**
- Getting ready
- Actual changeover
- Adjustments
- First-off inspection
- Rework first parts if needed

### 24.6.3.2 Video Analysis

**Most powerful SMED tool: Video the setup.**

**Benefits:**

**1. Objective Reality**
- Not what you think happens
- What actually happens
- Surprises guaranteed!

**2. Detailed Analysis**
- Frame-by-frame if needed
- Exact times
- Multiple reviewers

**3. Before/After Comparison**

- Wide angle (capture whole area)

**Setup:**
- Position to see operator and machine
- Include clock in frame (timestamp)
- Audio helpful (hear problems)

**Recording:**
- Start before setup begins
- Record continuously
- Don't stop for "boring parts" (wait time is data!)
- End with first good part

**Analysis:**
- Watch with team
- Note every activity (timestamp start/end)
- Classify: internal/external, value-added/waste
- Brainstorm improvements

### 24.6.3.3 Waste Identification

**Wastes in Setup:**

**1. Searching**
- Looking for tools
- Looking for fixtures
- Looking for programs
- Looking for parts/materials

**Solution:** Point-of-use storage, kitting, shadow boards

**2. Walking**
- To tool crib
- To office for program
- To get materials
- Back and forth

**Solution:** Stage everything before setup, point-of-use storage

**3. Waiting**
- For crane/forklift
- For other person
- For approval
- For first part to run

**Solution:** Scheduling, parallel operations, pre-planning

**4. Adjustments**
- Trial and error positioning
- "Run a part, measure, adjust, repeat"
- 10+ cycles sometimes

**Solution:** Preset tools, fixed positions, standardization

**5. Rework**
- First part(s) scrap
- Have to adjust and remake
- Learning curve each setup

**Solution:** Standard work, better training, pre-setting

**Typical Waste in Traditional Setup:**
- **Searching/Walking: 20-30%**
- **Adjustments: 30-40%**
- **Actual changeover work: 30-40%**

**Huge opportunity!**

## 24.6.4 SMED Improvement Techniques

### 24.6.4.1 Standardize Tooling and Fixtures

**Problem:** Every fixture different, every setup unique.

**Solution: Standardization**

**Fixture Standardization:**

**1. Standard Base Plate**
- Same bolt pattern
- Same height
- Same locating features
- Quick-change top plates

**2. Fixture Families**
- Similar parts use similar fixtures
- Modular components
- Mix and match

**3. Standard Clamping**
- Same clamps across fixtures
- Same torque requirements
- Same tools to operate

**Tooling Standardization:**

**1. Tool Holders**
- Standardize on one system (CAT40, HSK, etc.)
- Standard pull studs
- Standard lengths where possible

**2. Cutting Tools**
- Limit variety
- Standard inserts
- Standard tool assemblies

**3. Gaging**
- Standard inspection tools
- Stored at machine
- Quick access

**Benefits:**
- Faster changeover (familiarity)
- Fewer mistakes (consistency)
- Cross-training easier
- Spare parts simpler

### 24.6.4.2 Quick-Change Systems

**Replace Slow Methods with Fast Methods**

**Bolted Connections → Quick-Change:**

**Traditional:**
- 4 bolts holding fixture
- Each bolt: loosen 10 turns, remove, replace, tighten 10 turns
- 4 bolts × 20 turns = 80 turns
- Time: 5-10 minutes

**Quick-Change:**
- Cam-lock or toggle clamp
- 1/4 turn to lock/unlock
- 4 clamps × 1/4 turn = 1 turn
- Time: 30 seconds

**90% time reduction!**

**Options:**

**1. Cam Locks**
- Rotate 90° to lock
- High clamping force
- Repeatable

**2. Toggle Clamps**
- Flip lever
- Visual locked/unlocked
- Many styles

**3. Hydraulic/Pneumatic**
- Push button
- Consistent clamping force
- Fastest

**4. Magnetic Chucks**
- Instant on/off
- No clamping mechanism
- Limited applications

**Vise Jaws:**
- Quick-change jaws (dovetail, serrated)
- Pre-set jaw pairs
- Master jaws + soft jaws

**Pallets:**
- Standard pallet system
- Fixtures mounted on pallets
- Pallet change seconds
- Setup done offline on spare pallet

### 24.6.4.3 Visual Aids and Checklists

**Reduce Thinking and Errors**

**Setup Checklists:**
- Step-by-step sequence
- Checkboxes for each step
- Prevents skipped steps
- Training tool

**Visual Work Instructions:**
- Photos of correct setup
- Color-coded connections
- Arrows showing direction
- At point of use (laminated at machine)

**Color Coding:**
- Red fixture goes in red position
- Green tool in green holder
- Obvious matching

**Directional Indicators:**
- "This side up" labels
- Arrows for rotation direction
- Markings for alignment

**Shadow Boards:**
- Tool outline on board
- Missing tool obvious
- Return tools to correct spot

**Measurement Standards:**
- Go/no-go gages
- Pre-set measuring tools
- Eliminate thinking "what dimension?"

### 24.6.4.4 Parallel Operations

**Two or More People Working Simultaneously**

**When to Use:**
- Internal time > 10 minutes after other improvements
- Complex setups (many steps)
- Heavy fixtures (safety)
- Opportunities for simultaneous work

**Example:**

**Single Person Setup:**
1. Remove old fixture (5 min)
2. Install new fixture (5 min)
3. Change tools (8 min)
4. Load program, set offsets (4 min)
5. First part, inspect (5 min)
**Total: 27 minutes**

**Two-Person Setup (Parallel):**

| Person A | Person B | Time |
|----------|----------|------|
| Remove old fixture | Get new fixture, tools | 5 min |
| Install new fixture | Change tools | 5 min |
| Load program, offsets | Stage material | 4 min |
| First part (both inspect) | | 5 min |
**Total: 19 minutes** (30% faster)

**Requirements:**
- Coordination (practiced)
- Safety (clear communication)
- Standard work (each knows their role)
- Cost/benefit (labor cost vs. machine time value)

### 24.6.4.5 Eliminate Adjustments

**Adjustments are HUGE Time Wasters**

**Typical Adjustment Cycle:**
1. Run part
2. Measure
3. Adjust tool offset
4. Run another
5. Measure
6. Adjust again
7. Repeat 5-10 times until good

**Time: 20-30 minutes often!**

**Elimination Strategies:**

**1. Pre-Setting**
- Tool pre-setter machine offline
- Set all tool lengths before setup
- Load into machine with known offsets
- First part should be good

**2. Fixed Positions**
- Hard stops for fixtures
- Locating pins (poka-yoke)
- Repeatability = no adjustment
- Reference surfaces

**3. Standardized Fixtures**
- Fixture mounted same place every time
- Work offsets stored in control
- Recall program with offsets

**4. Proven Programs**
- Programs verified on first use
- No changes needed after
- Stored with correct offsets

**5. First-Off Verification (Not Adjustment)**
- Run first part
- Should be within tolerance (if not, something wrong—investigate)
- Verify, not adjust

**Goal:** **Zero adjustments during setup**

**Reality:** May need 1-2 minor tweaks, but not 10+ iteration loops

- Grid of holes or slots
- Subplates attach quickly (pins + clamps)
- Fixtures mounted on subplates

**Setup:**
- Fixtures pre-mounted on subplates offline
- Subplate + fixture as unit
- Quick-change to table master plate
- **Changeover: 1-2 minutes**

**Common Systems:**
- Erowa
- System 3R
- Chick
- Lang
- 5th Axis

**Tombstone Fixtures:**

**Workflow:**

**External (Offline):**
1. Assemble tools per setup sheet
2. Measure each tool on presetter
3. Record lengths and diameters
4. Kit tools in holder/tray
5. Generate tool list for CNC

**Internal (At Machine):**
1. Load tools from kit into magazine
2. Load tool list into control
3. Tools ready, no touching off
4. Run part (should be good!)

**Time Savings:**
- Traditional touch-off: 15-30 min
- Presetter method: 2 min (load tools)
- **Saves 13-28 minutes per setup**

**Quality Improvement:**
- Accurate measurement
- First part right

- No typing code at machine

### 24.6.5.4 First-Off Inspection Strategies

**First Part Inspection Can Take 10-20 Minutes**

**Optimize:**

**1. In-Process Inspection:**
- Critical dimensions checked during run
- Catch errors early
- Less to measure at end

**2. Inspection at Machine:**
- Gages stored at machine
- Operator does inspection
- No wait for QC

**3. Reduced Inspection:**
- Proven setups = sample only
- Not every dimension every time
- Risk-based inspection

**4. Go/No-Go Gages:**
- Faster than measurement
- Pass/fail decision
- Eliminate recording

**5. Automated Inspection:**
- Probe in machine
- Automatic measurement
- Immediate feedback

**6. Standard Work for Inspection:**
- Checklist of critical dimensions
- Documented method
- Consistent

## Summary

Single Minute Exchange of Dies (SMED) reduces setup time to single digits (< 10 minutes), enabling small batches, flexibility, and reduced inventory. The three-step methodology—separate internal/external setup, convert internal to external, streamline all activities—achieves dramatic reductions (50-95% common).

CNC-specific SMED techniques include quick-change fixtures, tool presetting, program standardization, and optimized first-off inspection. SMED requires discipline to sustain: standard work, training, visual management, and continuous improvement.

Quick changeovers are foundational to Lean manufacturing, enabling pull systems, heijunka, and one-piece flow.
