# Module 24 – L.E.A.N. Strategies for CNC Manufacturing


## 24.3.1 What is Value Stream Mapping?

**Value Stream Mapping (VSM)** is a Lean tool used to visualize the complete flow of materials and information required to bring a product from order to delivery.

### Definition

**Value Stream:** All activities (both value-added and non-value-added) required to bring a product through the main flows:
1. **Production flow:** From raw material to customer
2. **Design flow:** From concept to launch
3. **Order flow:** From order entry to delivery

**Value Stream Map:** Visual representation showing every process step, with data on cycle times, changeover times, uptime, number of operators, WIP inventory, and information flows.

### Purpose of VSM

**See the Whole:**
- Not just individual processes, but the entire flow
- Identify where value is created vs. waste occurs
- Understand the system, not just the parts

**Common Language:**
- Cross-functional teams see the same picture
- Production, engineering, quality, materials all aligned
- Eliminates finger-pointing ("it's their fault")

**Foundation for Improvement:**
- Current state map shows reality
- Future state map shows vision
- Implementation plan bridges the gap

**Quote from Mike Rother & John Shook:**
*"Value stream mapping is a pencil and paper tool that helps you see and understand the flow of material and information as a product makes its way through the value stream."*

### When to Use VSM

**Ideal Applications:**
- Beginning a Lean transformation
- Chronic delivery or quality problems
- Excessive inventory or long lead times
- Poor communication between departments
- Before major capital investments
- Product family rationalization

**Less Suitable:**
- Very low volume (one-off custom engineering)
- Highly variable processes (R&D, creative work)
- When quick action needed (use Kaizen event instead)

## 24.3.3 Creating a Current State Map

The current state map documents how things actually work today—not how they should work, not how the procedures say, but reality.

### 24.3.3.1 Selecting the Product Family

**Product Family:** Group of products that pass through similar processing steps using common equipment.

**Why Start with One Family?**
- Manageable scope
- Faster results
- Learn by doing
- Prove the concept
- Build capability

**Selection Criteria:**

**High Business Impact:**
- High revenue product
- Problem product (late deliveries, quality issues)
- Strategic customer
- High volume

**Representative:**
- Typical of other products
- Success can be replicated

**Achievable:**
- Not too complex for first VSM
- Team has authority to change

**Example: CNC Job Shop Product Families**

| Family | Description | Common Routing |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Shaft Family | Round parts, 0.5-3" dia | Lathe → Grind → Inspect |
| Housing Family | Aluminum housings | Mill → Drill → Tap → Inspect |
| Bracket Family | Small steel brackets | Laser Cut → Bend → Weld |
| Plate Family | Large aluminum plates | Mill (roughing) → Mill (finishing) |

**Choose ONE family to start.**

### 24.3.3.2 Walking the Process

**"Go to Gemba"** – See the actual process with your own eyes.

**Team Composition:**
- Value stream manager (leads the map)
- Representatives from each process step
- Support functions (quality, maintenance, materials)
- Someone who knows VSM methodology
- **5-8 people ideal**

**Walking the Process:**

**1. Start at Shipping (Work Backwards):**
- How do finished goods get to customer?
- What triggers shipment?
- How much inventory is here?

**2. Walk Upstream to Each Process:**
- Follow the physical flow
- Observe actual work
- Talk to operators (they know reality)
- Don't skip steps

**3. Note Everything:**
- Process steps
- Inventory piles
- Information flows
- Quality checks
- Material handling
- Wait times

**4. End at Receiving:**
- How do materials arrive?
- What triggers orders?
- Supplier performance

**Tips:**
- Take photos (with permission)
- Use stopwatch for cycle times
- Count inventory physically
- Get actual data, not estimates
- 2-4 hours for first walk

### 24.3.3.3 Collecting Data

**Data Needed for Each Process:**

**Time Data:**
- **Cycle Time (C/T):** Time to complete one piece (seconds or minutes)
  - Measure actual, not theoretical
  - Include load/unload, not just machine time
  - Average over multiple cycles
- **Changeover Time (C/O):** Time from last good part of previous job to first good part of new job
  - Include all setup activities
  - Important for batch sizing
- **Available Time:** Hours per shift × shifts × days
  - Minus breaks, meetings, planned downtime

**Reliability Data:**
- **Uptime %:** Actual run time ÷ available time
  - Track breakdowns, unplanned stops
  - 85% uptime = 15% loss to breakdowns

**Staffing:**
- **Number of Operators:** People required to run process
  - Full-time equivalent
  - Per shift

**Batch & Inventory:**
- **Batch Size:** Typical production quantity
- **EPE (Every Part Every):** How often each part runs
  - Daily? Weekly? Monthly?
- **WIP Inventory:** Count pieces between operations
  - Convert to days or hours of demand

**Quality:**
- **First Time Through (FTT) %:** Percent of parts passing without rework
- **Scrap %:** Percent scrapped

**How to Collect:**
- **Stopwatch studies** for cycle times
- **Maintenance logs** for uptime
- **Production records** for batch sizes
- **Physical count** for inventory
- **Ask operators** – they know!

### 24.3.3.4 Drawing the Current State

**Tools Needed:**
- Large paper (36" × 48" or bigger) or whiteboard
- Sticky notes (for easy changes)
- Pencils, markers
- VSM symbol stencil (or draw freehand)

**Drawing Steps:**

**1. Customer & Supplier (Top Corners):**
```
┌─────────┐                           ┌─────────┐
│SUPPLIER │                           │CUSTOMER │
└─────────┘                           └─────────┘
```

**2. Production Control (Top Center):**
```
              ╔══════════╗
              ║PRODUCTION║
              ║ CONTROL  ║
              ╚══════════╝
```

**3. Process Boxes (Center, Left to Right):**
Draw each process step across the page in sequence.

**4. Data Boxes Below Each Process:**
Fill in C/T, C/O, uptime, etc.

**5. Inventory Triangles Between Processes:**
Show WIP with quantity/days.

**6. Material Flow Arrows:**
Connect processes with push or pull arrows.

**7. Information Flows (Top Half):**
- Customer orders to production control
- Production control schedules to each process
- Forecasts, MRP, manual instructions

**8. Shipment Frequency:**
- To customer (daily? weekly?)
- From supplier

**9. Timeline (Bottom):**
- Value-added time under each process
- Lead time (inventory time) between processes
- Total at bottom right

**10. Summary Metrics (Bottom Right):**
```
Total Lead Time: 20 days
Total Value-Added Time: 2.5 hours
VA Ratio: 0.5%
```

**Example Current State (Simplified):**
```

## 24.3.4 Analyzing the Current State

Once the current state map is complete, analyze it to understand problems and opportunities.

### 24.3.4.1 Process Time vs. Lead Time

**Process Time (Value-Added Time):**
- Sum of all cycle times
- Time actually transforming the product
- What customer pays for

**Lead Time (Total Time):**
- Time from order to delivery
- Includes all waiting, queuing, batching
- What customer experiences

**The Gap is Opportunity:**

**Example:**
- Process Time: 2 hours
- Lead Time: 15 days = 360 hours
- **Gap: 358 hours (99.4% waste!)**

**Where is the gap?**
- Inventory wait time
- Batching delays
- Transportation
- Rework loops
- Waiting for approvals

**Goal:** Reduce gap by eliminating waste.

### 24.3.4.2 Value-Added vs. Non-Value-Added

**Calculate VA Ratio:**

VA Ratio = Total Value-Added Time ÷ Total Lead Time

**Example:**
- VA Time: 2.5 hours
- Lead Time: 20 days × 8 hrs = 160 hours
- **VA Ratio = 2.5 ÷ 160 = 1.56%**

**Only 1.56% of time adds value!**

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- **Traditional manufacturing:** 1-5% VA ratio
- **Lean manufacturing:** 10-30% VA ratio
- **World-class:** 30%+ VA ratio

**Where's the other 98.44%?**
- Waiting (inventory between operations)
- Batching (parts sit while batch completes)
- Transportation
- Inspection delays
- Rework

### 24.3.4.3 Identifying Bottlenecks

**Bottleneck:** Process step with longest cycle time or lowest capacity.

**Bottleneck determines system capacity** (Theory of Constraints).

**How to Identify:**

**1. Compare Cycle Times:**
- Process A: 30 sec/pc
- Process B: 60 sec/pc ← **Bottleneck**
- Process C: 45 sec/pc

**2. Look for Inventory Build-Up:**
- Large WIP queue before a process = bottleneck
- Starved process (no WIP) after bottleneck

**3. Calculate Capacity:**
- Available time ÷ cycle time = capacity
- Lowest capacity = bottleneck

**Example:**

| Process | C/T | Available Time | Capacity (pcs/day) |
|---------|-----|----------------|---------------------|
| Lathe   | 2 min | 450 min/day | 225 |
| Mill    | 5 min | 450 min/day | **90** ← Bottleneck |
| Grind   | 3 min | 450 min/day | 150 |

**System capacity limited to 90 pcs/day** (bottleneck).

**Implications:**
- Don't overproduce at lathe (creates excess WIP)
- Focus improvement on mill (biggest impact)
- Offload mill work if possible

**Elevate the Constraint:**
- Add capacity at bottleneck
- Reduce cycle time at bottleneck
- Offload work to non-bottlenecks
- Ensure bottleneck never starved or blocked

## 24.3.5 Designing the Future State

The future state map is your vision of how the value stream should operate after Lean improvements.

### 24.3.5.1 Applying L.E.A.N. Principles

**Future State Questions (from Rother & Shook):**

**1. What is takt time?**
- Available time ÷ customer demand
- Pace of production to match demand
- *Covered in Section 24.4.2*

**2. Will you build to a finished goods supermarket or directly to shipping?**
- Make-to-stock → supermarket
- Make-to-order → direct shipping

**3. Where can you use continuous flow?**
- Eliminate batches
- One-piece flow wherever possible
- Group operations into cells

**4. Where will you need pull systems?**
- Can't flow everything
- Use pull/Kanban for disconnected processes

**5. What single point will you use to schedule production?**
- Pacemaker process
- Only one point receives schedule
- Upstream pulled, downstream flows

**6. How will you level the production mix?**
- Smooth demand variation
- Produce small batches of each product regularly
- Avoid large batches and long changeovers

**7. What increment of work will you consistently release?**
- Pitch: Consistent work unit
- Example: One container every 20 minutes

**8. What process improvements are necessary?**
- Kaizen bursts on current state
- What must change to enable future state?

### 24.3.5.2 Continuous Flow Opportunities

**Continuous Flow (One-Piece Flow):**
- Parts move one at a time from process to process
- No batching, no queuing
- Immediate quality feedback
- Shortest lead time

**Where to Apply Flow:**

**Good Candidates:**
- Processes physically close (or can be)
- Similar cycle times (balanced)
- Reliable processes (high uptime)
- Stable demand
- Common product family

**Create Cells:**
- Group operations together
- U-shaped layout
- Operator moves with part
- Cross-training enables flexibility

**Benefits:**
- Lead time: days → hours or minutes
- WIP inventory: eliminated
- Floor space: 30-50% reduction
- Quality: defects caught immediately

**Example:**

**Before (Batch):**
```
Lathe (batch 50) → [10 days WIP] → Mill (batch 50) → [5 days WIP] → Grind (batch 50)
Lead time: 15+ days
```

**After (Flow Cell):**
```
Lathe → Mill → Grind (one-piece flow in U-cell)
Lead time: 10 minutes
```

### 24.3.5.3 Pull System Implementation

**Where Flow Not Possible:**
- Shared resources (heat treat, painting)
- Vastly different cycle times
- Geographical separation
- Supplier relationships

**Use Pull (Kanban):**
- Downstream consumes inventory
- Signal sent upstream to replenish
- Inventory limited to Kanban quantity

**Supermarket:**
- Small, controlled inventory
- Each SKU has location
- Visual min/max levels
- Pull replenishment

**Benefits:**
- Eliminate overproduction
- Right-size inventory
- Visual control
- Self-regulating

*Kanban covered in detail in Section 24.5*

## 24.3.6 Implementation Planning

The value stream map identifies what to improve. The implementation plan determines how and when.

### Value Stream Plan

**Kaizen Bursts on Map:**
- Each burst = improvement needed
- Number them
- Prioritize

**Implementation Loop:**

**Annual Improvement:**
- Big changes (layout, equipment)
- Requires capital, planning

**Kaizen Events (Weeks):**
- Quick improvement bursts
- Cross-functional team
- 3-5 days intense focus
- *Covered in Section 24.10*

**Point Kaizen (Daily/Weekly):**
- Small improvements
- Operator-led
- Continuous

**Create Value Stream Plan:**

| # | Improvement | Type | Responsibility | Start | Complete | Metrics |
|---|-------------|------|----------------|-------|----------|---------|
| 1 | SMED on Mill | Kaizen | John S. | Week 2 | Week 3 | C/O: 60→15 min |
| 2 | Create Assembly Cell | Annual | Engineering | Month 2 | Month 4 | LT: 5d→4hr |
| 3 | Kanban for Hardware | Kaizen | Mary T. | Week 5 | Week 6 | Inv: 30d→5d |

**Review Cadence:**
- Monthly value stream review
- Track progress
- Adjust plan
- Celebrate wins

**Communication:**
- Share maps with all stakeholders
- Visual display in Gemba
- Update as changes implemented

## 24.3.7 VSM for CNC Job Shops vs. High-Volume

### High-Volume (Repetitive Manufacturing)

**Characteristics:**
- Limited product variety
- High volume per product
- Dedicated lines/equipment
- Stable, predictable demand

**VSM Approach:**
- Map one product (representative)
- Design continuous flow cells
- Takt time drives balancing
- Kanban for purchased parts
- Pacemaker sets rhythm

**Example:** Automotive stamping, consumer electronics assembly

### CNC Job Shops (High-Mix, Low-Volume)

**Characteristics:**
- Wide product variety
- Low volume per product
- Shared equipment
- Variable, unpredictable demand

**VSM Challenges:**
- Can't map every product
- Flow difficult with shared resources
- Demand variability

**Adapted Approach:**

**1. Product Families:**
- Group by similar routing
- Map the family, not individual products

**2. Flexible Cells:**
- Cell can handle family variations
- Quick changeover critical (SMED)
- Cross-trained operators

**3. Shared Resources:**
- Supermarket before/after shared process
- Pull system manages flow
- Visual scheduling

**4. Focus on Lead Time:**
- Reduce batch sizes (via SMED)
- Eliminate queue time
- Better scheduling

**5. Capacity Management:**
- Load leveling
- Mixed-model scheduling
- Manage bottlenecks actively

*Job shop Lean strategies covered in Section 24.18*

## Summary

Value Stream Mapping is a pencil-and-paper tool that makes the entire product flow visible, from raw material to customer delivery. The current state map documents reality, revealing waste and opportunities. The future state map designs the Lean vision using continuous flow, pull systems, and other Lean principles. The implementation plan bridges current and future states through Kaizen events, annual improvements, and daily continuous improvement.

VSM provides a common language for cross-functional teams and creates the blueprint for Lean transformation. It's especially powerful because it shows the system, not just individual processes, enabling systemic improvements rather than local optimizations.
