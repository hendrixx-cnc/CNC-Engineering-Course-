# Module 21 – Metrology and Precision Measurement


## 21.2.1 International Standards (ISO, ASME, DIN)

Measurement standards provide a common language for dimensional verification across industries and nations. Three major standards systems dominate precision manufacturing:

### ISO (International Organization for Standardization)

The ISO system is used globally, particularly in Europe and Asia.

**Key ISO Standards for Metrology**:

- **ISO 1101**: Geometrical Product Specifications (GPS) – defines GD&T symbols and concepts
- **ISO 286**: System of limits and fits – standardizes hole and shaft tolerances
- **ISO 1**: Standard reference temperature of 20°C for length measurements
- **ISO 3650**: Gage blocks specifications
- **ISO 4287**: Surface texture parameters (Ra, Rz, etc.)
- **ISO 10360**: Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) acceptance tests
- **ISO 14253**: Decision rules for proving conformance with specifications

### ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers)

ASME standards are dominant in North America.

**Key ASME Standards**:

- **ASME Y14.5**: Dimensioning and Tolerancing – the definitive North American GD&T standard
- **ASME B89.1.9**: Gage blocks
- **ASME B89.4.1**: Coordinate measuring machines
- **ASME B46.1**: Surface texture parameters
- **ASME Y14.43**: Dimensioning and tolerancing principles for gages and fixtures

### DIN (Deutsches Institut für Normung)

German standards that influenced both ISO and ASME systems.

**Key DIN Standards**:

- **DIN 862**: Calipers
- **DIN 863**: Micrometers
- **DIN 2257-1**: Gage blocks
- **DIN 4768**: Surface roughness

## 21.2.2 Gage Blocks and Reference Standards

Gage blocks are the fundamental physical length standards used in shops and calibration labs.

### What Are Gage Blocks?

Gage blocks are precision ground rectangular blocks of hardened steel, carbide, or ceramic with:
- Two extremely flat, parallel measuring faces
- Dimensions accurate to millionths of an inch
- Surfaces so flat they can "wring" together (adhere via molecular attraction)

### Gage Block Grades

**ASME B89.1.9 / ISO 3650 Grades**:

| Grade | Tolerance | Application |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Grade 0.5** | ±(0.5 + L/400) μm | Reference standards in calibration labs |
| **Grade 1** | ±(0.8 + L/400) μm | Laboratory masters |
| **Grade 2** | ±(1.0 + L/400) μm | Inspection room use |
| **Grade 3** | ±(1.5 + L/400) μm | Shop floor setups |

## 21.2.3 Calibration Hierarchies and Traceability

Calibration is the process of comparing a measurement instrument against a known reference standard and documenting the results.

### The Calibration Hierarchy

**Level 1 – Primary Standards**: Maintained by national metrology institutes (NIST, NPL, PTB)

**Level 2 – Secondary Standards**: Maintained by accredited calibration laboratories

**Level 3 – Working Standards**: Used in quality labs and inspection rooms

**Level 4 – Production Instruments**: Used for daily production measurement

## 21.2.4 Calibration Intervals and Documentation

Calibration intervals balance cost with risk. Common intervals:
- Precision instruments (CMM probes, laser systems): 6-12 months
- Shop micrometers and calipers: 12 months
- Working gage blocks: 1-3 years
- Reference standards: 1-5 years

## 21.2.5 Temperature Compensation (20°C Reference)

ISO 1 establishes **20°C (68°F)** as the standard reference temperature for all dimensional measurements.

**Linear Thermal Expansion Formula**:

```
ΔL = α × L × ΔT
```

Where:
- ΔL = Change in length
- α = Coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE)
- L = Original length
- ΔT = Change in temperature from reference

### Coefficients of Thermal Expansion

| Material | CTE (ppm/°C) |
|----------|--------------|
| Aluminum | 23.0 |
| Steel (carbon) | 11.5 |
| Stainless steel | 17.3 |
| Titanium | 8.6 |
| Granite | 8.0 |
