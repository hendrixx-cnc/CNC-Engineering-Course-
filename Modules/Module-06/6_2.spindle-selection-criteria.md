# Module 6 – Spindle & Rotary Tools


## Introduction

Spindle selection determines CNC machine capability: an undersized spindle limits material removal rates and restricts tool diameter, while an oversized spindle wastes capital (cost difference of $5,000-$20,000) and operating energy. Systematic selection methodology balances application requirements (material, cutting parameters, duty cycle) against spindle specifications (power, speed, torque envelope, thermal rating) to identify the minimum-cost spindle that meets performance needs with 15-25% margin for process variability and future capability expansion.

This section presents quantitative selection criteria based on cutting mechanics (Section 6.5), motor characteristics (Section 6.3), and thermal management (Section 6.4), culminating in a selection matrix and commissioning acceptance tests.

## Application Requirements Analysis

### Material and Cutting Parameters

Material properties and cutting conditions establish power and speed requirements:

**Specific cutting energy** $K_c$ (N/mm²) represents force per unit chip area:

| Material | $K_c$ (N/mm²) | Typical Applications | Speed Range (rpm) |
|----------|---------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Aluminum 6061-T6 | 700-900 | Aerospace, automotive | 12,000-24,000 |
| Mild steel (1020) | 1,800-2,200 | Fixtures, tooling | 3,000-8,000 |
| Stainless 304 | 2,200-2,800 | Food, medical | 2,000-6,000 |
| Titanium Ti-6Al-4V | 2,800-3,500 | Aerospace, medical | 1,500-4,000 |
| Plastics (acrylic, ABS) | 400-600 | Prototyping, signage | 18,000-30,000 |
| Wood (hardwood) | 200-400 | Furniture, cabinetry | 18,000-24,000 |

**Required cutting power** from material removal rate:

$$P_{cut} = \frac{K_c \cdot a_p \cdot a_e \cdot v_f}{\eta_{mech} \cdot 60,000}$$

where:
- $P_{cut}$ = cutting power (kW)
- $K_c$ = specific cutting energy (N/mm²)
- $a_p$ = axial depth of cut (mm)
- $a_e$ = radial depth of cut (mm)
- $v_f$ = feed rate (mm/min)
- $\eta_{mech}$ = mechanical efficiency (0.80-0.90 for direct drive, 0.70-0.85 for belt drive)

**Required spindle speed** from surface cutting velocity:

$$n = \frac{1000 \cdot v_c}{\pi \cdot D_{tool}}$$

where:
- $n$ = spindle speed (rpm)
- $v_c$ = cutting speed (m/min, from material data)
- $D_{tool}$ = tool diameter (mm)

### Worked Example 6.2.1 - Application Sizing for Aluminum Milling

**Given Application:**
- Material: Aluminum 6061-T6, $K_c = 800$ N/mm²
- Tool: 8 mm diameter end mill, 2 flutes
- Cutting speed: $v_c = 300$ m/min (typical for carbide in aluminum)
- Feed per tooth: $f_z = 0.15$ mm/tooth
- Axial depth: $a_p = 4$ mm (half diameter)
- Radial depth: $a_e = 2$ mm (25% slotting)
- Mechanical efficiency: $\eta_{mech} = 0.85$ (direct drive spindle)

**Calculate required spindle speed:**

$$n = \frac{1000 \times 300}{\pi \times 8} = \frac{300,000}{25.13} = 11,940 \text{ rpm}$$

**Calculate feed rate:**

$$v_f = f_z \times z \times n = 0.15 \times 2 \times 11,940 = 3,582 \text{ mm/min}$$

**Calculate cutting power:**

$$P_{cut} = \frac{800 \times 4 \times 2 \times 3,582}{0.85 \times 60,000} = \frac{22,924,800}{51,000} = 449.5 \text{ W} = 0.45 \text{ kW}$$

**Required spindle specifications (with 25% margin):**
- Minimum speed: 12,000 rpm (actual: 11,940 rpm)
- Minimum power: 0.56 kW at 12,000 rpm (0.45 kW × 1.25)
- Recommended: 1.5-2.2 kW spindle with 8,000-24,000 rpm range

**Torque verification at 12,000 rpm:**

$$T = \frac{P \times 9549}{n} = \frac{560 \times 9549}{12,000} = 446 \text{ N·mm} = 0.45 \text{ N·m}$$

Most 1.5-2.2 kW spindles provide 1-2 N·m at 12,000 rpm, confirming adequate torque.

## Power-Torque-Speed Envelope Matching

### Constant Torque and Constant Power Regions

Spindle motors (Section 6.3) deliver maximum torque from standstill to base speed, then operate in constant power mode as speed increases:

$$P = \frac{T \cdot n}{9549}$$

where $P$ is power (kW), $T$ is torque (N·m), and $n$ is speed (rpm).

**Torque available in constant power region:**

$$T_{available}(n) = \frac{P_{rated} \times 9549}{n}$$

For a 3 kW spindle:
- At 6,000 rpm (base speed): $T = 3 \times 9549 / 6000 = 4.77$ N·m
- At 12,000 rpm: $T = 3 \times 9549 / 12000 = 2.39$ N·m
- At 24,000 rpm: $T = 3 \times 9549 / 24000 = 1.19$ N·m

**Selection guideline:** Ensure cutting power requirement falls within spindle's constant power region at target operating speed. Avoid operating below 30% or above 90% of maximum speed for thermal and mechanical stability.

## Duty Cycle and Thermal Considerations

### IEC Duty Cycle Ratings

IEC 60034-1 defines duty cycles for motors:

- **S1 (Continuous):** 100% rated power indefinitely
- **S3 (Intermittent):** Cycles of loaded/unloaded operation (e.g., S3-40% means 40% on, 60% off)
- **S6 (Continuous periodic):** Cycles of loaded/no-load (e.g., S6-40% means 40% full load, 60% no load, continuously)

**Equivalent power for intermittent duty:**

$$P_{eq} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_i P_i^2 \cdot t_i}{\sum_i t_i}}$$

where $P_i$ is power in phase $i$ and $t_i$ is duration of phase $i$.

### Worked Example 6.2.2 - Duty Cycle Thermal Check

**Given machining cycle (10-minute repeat):**
- Roughing: 2.5 kW for 3 minutes
- Finishing: 1.0 kW for 2 minutes
- Tool change / idle: 0.2 kW for 5 minutes (spindle rotating, no load)

**Calculate equivalent continuous power:**

$$P_{eq} = \sqrt{\frac{(2.5^2 \times 3) + (1.0^2 \times 2) + (0.2^2 \times 5)}{3 + 2 + 5}}$$

$$P_{eq} = \sqrt{\frac{18.75 + 2.0 + 0.2}{10}} = \sqrt{\frac{20.95}{10}} = \sqrt{2.095} = 1.45 \text{ kW}$$

**Thermal assessment:**
- Equivalent power: 1.45 kW
- Consider 3 kW spindle rated S1 continuous: Thermal utilization = 1.45/3.0 = 48%
- Conclusion: 3 kW spindle has adequate thermal margin (52% reserve)

**Temperature rise verification:**
Spindle bearings should reach thermal equilibrium <60°C above ambient. For $P_{eq} = 1.45$ kW with typical cooling, expect 35-45°C temperature rise, acceptable for continuous operation.

## Integration Constraints

### Tool Interface Selection

## Key Takeaways

1. **Cutting power calculation** from specific cutting energy, depth, width, and feed rate using $P_{cut} = K_c \cdot a_p \cdot a_e \cdot v_f / (\eta \cdot 60,000)$ establishes minimum spindle power requirement with 25% margin

2. **Required spindle speed** from target surface speed and tool diameter: $n = 1000 \cdot v_c / (\pi \cdot D_{tool})$ determines if spindle speed range matches application

3. **Power-torque-speed relationship** $P = T \cdot n / 9549$ defines available torque at operating speed; verify cutting torque requirement falls within constant power region (30-90% maximum speed)

4. **Equivalent power for intermittent duty** using $P_{eq} = \sqrt{\sum P_i^2 \cdot t_i / \sum t_i}$ determines thermal loading; compare to spindle continuous rating (S1) or duty cycle rating (S3, S6)

5. **Selection matrix** compares candidate spindles across speed range, torque, power, duty cycle, tool interface, runout, cooling, and bearing specifications; select minimum-cost option meeting all requirements with margin

6. **Tool interface choice** depends on application: ER collets for flexibility and manual change, HSK for high-speed and automatic tool change, CAT/BT for heavy machining

7. **Runout requirement** driven by part tolerance: <5 μm TIR for ±0.005-0.01 mm tolerances, <8 μm for ±0.02 mm tolerances

8. **Commissioning acceptance** requires speed accuracy ±1%, runout verification per ISO 10791-6, thermal stability within 45 minutes, and machining performance tests confirming surface finish <1.6 μm Ra and dimensions within ±0.02 mm
