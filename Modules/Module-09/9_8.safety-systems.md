## Risk Assessment

**Hazard Identification**

Mechanical Hazards:

- Shearing at joints or between gripper jaws
- Entanglement in moving cables or linkages

Electrical Hazards:
- Contact with live parts (motors, drives)
- Arc flash from high-power systems

Other Hazards:
- Pneumatic system pressure release
- Flying parts from gripper failures
- Noise from pneumatic systems

**Risk Evaluation**

Severity × Probability = Risk Level

Severity:
- S1: Slight injury (bruise, minor cut)
- S2: Serious injury (fracture, amputation)
- S3: Fatal injury

Probability:
- P1: Low (remote possibility)
- P2: Medium (occasional)
- P3: High (frequent or continuous exposure)

**Risk Reduction Hierarchy**
1. Eliminate hazard (inherently safe design)
2. Guard against hazard (physical barriers, interlocks)
3. Warn about hazard (lights, alarms, signs)
4. Train and supervise personnel (PPE, procedures)

## Safeguarding Methods

**Physical Guards**

Fixed Guards:
- Permanent panels or fencing
- No moving parts
- Requires tools to remove
- Lowest cost, highest reliability
- Examples: Wire mesh panels, polycarbonate enclosures

Interlocked Guards:
- Opens for access
- Safety switch (guard lock)
- Robot stops when guard open
- ISO 14119 compliant switches
- Two-channel redundant monitoring

Access Gates:
- Pedestrian or material access
- Trapped key interlocks (access only when robot stopped)
- Time delay (prevent re-entry after closing)

**Perimeter Guarding**

Fence Specifications:
- Height: Minimum 1800mm (6 ft)
- Mesh opening: <50mm to prevent reach-through
- Distance to hazard: Minimum 100mm (guard to robot when fully extended)

Gates and Openings:
- Self-closing and interlocked
- Trapped key systems for maintenance access
- Lockout/tagout provisions

**Presence-Sensing Devices**

Light Curtains:
- Type 4 per IEC 61496
- Protected height: 300-1800mm typical
- Resolution: 14mm, 30mm, or 50mm
- Response time: <20ms
- Safety category 4, PLe per ISO 13849

Safety Laser Scanners:
- 2D or 3D area monitoring
- Configurable warning and protective zones
- Automatic zone switching (different areas for different modes)
- Examples: SICK S3000, Keyence SZ-V

Safety Mats:
- Pressure-sensitive floor mats
- Detect personnel entry to zone
- Lower reliability than optical sensors
- Useful for large floor areas

**Safety Relays and Controllers**

Safety PLC:
- Redundant processors
- Self-checking architecture
- Examples: Pilz PNOZ, Allen-Bradley GuardLogix, Siemens S7-1200F

Dual-Channel Safety:
- Two independent safety circuits
- Discrepancy detection
- Fail-safe design (power off = safe state)

**Emergency Stop (E-Stop)**

Requirements:
- Red mushroom button on yellow background
- Diameter: 40mm minimum
- Direct-opening action (mechanically linked contacts)
- Latching (manual reset required)
- Category 0 (immediate stop) or Category 1 (controlled stop)

Placement:
- Accessible from all operator positions
- At control pendant
- On robot body if accessible
- On external control panels

E-Stop Circuit:
```
[E-Stop 1] --串联-- [E-Stop 2] --串联-- [Safety Relay] --> [Motor Power Contactors]
```

Series connection: Any e-stop opens circuit.

## Safety Functions

**Safe Torque Off (STO)**
- Removes power to motor drives
- Robot coasts to stop (Category 0)
- Does not control deceleration
- Basic safety function (PLd or PLe)

**Safe Stop 1 (SS1)**
- Controlled deceleration
- Power removed after stop (Category 1)
- Prevents uncontrolled motion
- Requires safe motion monitoring

**Safe Stop 2 (SS2)**
- Controlled stop, power maintained
- Holds position
- Used for temporary stops
- Requires continuous position monitoring

**Safely-Limited Speed (SLS)**
- Monitors robot speed
- Stops if exceeds limit
- Enables teaching/maintenance modes
- Typical limit: 250 mm/s for hand-guiding

**Safe Reduced Speed (SRS)**
- Reduces maximum speed in certain zones or modes
- Enables closer operator proximity

**Safe Operating Stop (SOS)**
- Monitors that robot is stationary
- Power maintained
- Allows safe operations near stopped robot

## Operating Modes

**Automatic Mode**
- Full speed operation
- All guards closed and interlocked
- No personnel in hazard zone
- Production mode

**Manual Mode (Teach/Setup)**
- Reduced speed (<250 mm/s)
- Three-position enabling switch (dead-man switch)
- Operator inside guarded area
- Requires mode selector key switch

**Maintenance Mode**
- Lockout/tagout required
- All energy sources isolated
- Physical locks on power disconnects
- Permits inside control panel

## Collaborative Operation

**ISO/TS 15066 Requirements**

For robots working with humans without guarding:

Power and Force Limiting:
- Contact force <150N (body)
- Contact pressure depends on body region
- Transient (<0.5s) vs. quasi-static contact
- Built-in sensors or motor current monitoring

Speed and Separation Monitoring:
- Minimum separation distance maintained
- Robot slows or stops as operator approaches
- Safety-rated position sensors
- Requires 3D monitoring (laser scanners)

Hand Guiding:
- Operator physically guides robot
- Force sensor on end effector
- Reduced speed
- Three-position enabling switch

**Applications for Pick and Place**

Limited collaborative operation:
- Robot operates in automatic mode when separated
- Slows or stops when operator enters shared zone
- Typical for machine tending with occasional operator access

Not typically fully collaborative due to high speeds.

## Safety Circuit Design

**Category 3 Architecture**
- Dual-channel monitoring
- Single fault safe
- Fault detection via cross-monitoring
- Suitable for PLd

Example circuit:
```
[Guard 1 Contact A] ----+----> [Safety Relay Input A]
[Guard 2 Contact A] ----+

[Guard 1 Contact B] ----+----> [Safety Relay Input B]
[Guard 2 Contact B] ----+

Safety Relay monitors channel discrepancy.
If A≠B, fault detected, outputs disabled.
```

**Category 4 Architecture**
- Similar to Category 3
- Additional redundancy and fault exclusion
- Required for PLe applications

## Warning Devices

**Visual Indicators**

Stack Lights:
- Red: Fault/E-stop
- Yellow: Warning/reduced speed
- Green: Running automatic
- Blue: Manual/teach mode (optional)

Strobes/Beacons:
- Flash before robot motion starts
- Warn of automatic operation

**Audible Alarms**
- Horn or siren before automatic start
- 3-second delay after guard close before motion
- Distinctive sounds for different conditions

**Floor Markings**
- Yellow striped tape marks hazard zone
- Red zone: Do not enter during operation
- ANSI/ISO safety colors

## Validation and Testing

**Commissioning Checks**

E-Stop Function:
- Press each e-stop button
- Verify immediate robot stop
- Verify power removal
- Test reset function

Guard Interlock:
- Open each guard
- Verify robot stop
- Attempt to start with guard open (should fail)
- Close guard and verify restart

Light Curtain:
- Break beam with test piece
- Verify robot stop
- Measure stopping time and distance
- Verify muting functions (if applicable)

**Periodic Testing**

Daily:
- Visual inspection of guards
- E-stop function test
- Light curtain beam check

Monthly:
- Full interlock function test
- Safety relay diagnostics
- Light curtain alignment

Annually:
- Complete risk assessment review
- Safety function response time measurement

## Common Violations and Mistakes

**Inadequate Guarding**
- Gaps in fence allowing reach-in
- Guards easily removable without tools
- Insufficient height

- Disabling light curtains

**Improper E-Stop Circuit**
- Single-channel only
- No mechanical latching
- Insufficient number/placement

**Lack of Training**
- Operators unaware of hazards
- Maintenance without lockout/tagout
- No emergency procedures

**Non-Safety-Rated Components**
- Standard relays instead of safety relays
- Non-rated sensors
- Inadequate performance level

## Best Practices

- Design inherently safe first (limit force, speed, energy)
- Use safety-rated components throughout
- Redundant monitoring for critical functions
- Regular testing and maintenance
- Comprehensive operator training
- Clear documentation
- Risk assessment review after any modifications
