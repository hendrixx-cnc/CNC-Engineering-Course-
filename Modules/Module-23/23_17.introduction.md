# Module 23 – Shop Organization and Management


## Introduction

**Knowledge without action is useless.** This module has covered extensive theory and methods for shop organization. Now: **How do you actually implement it?**

**The Challenge:**

Many shops recognize the need for better organization but struggle:
- **Overwhelmed**: Too much to do—where to start?
- **Resistance**: Employees resist change
- **Competing priorities**: Daily firefighting crowds out improvement
- **Lack of resources**: Time, money, expertise
- **Loss of momentum**: Start strong, fade out

**The Reality:**

Transformation doesn't happen overnight. It's a **journey**—months to years of sustained effort.

**Success Factors:**

1. **Leadership commitment**: Non-negotiable
2. **Start small**: Build momentum with quick wins
3. **Involve people**: Engage employees, not dictate
4. **Be patient**: Culture change takes time
5. **Persist**: Don't quit when it gets hard

**This section covers:**
- Assessing current state
- Creating an implementation plan
- Pilot areas and quick wins
- Change management
- Training and skill development
- Sustaining organizational excellence
- Case studies and success stories

- **20-29**: Fair (significant opportunities, prioritize improvements)
- **10-19**: Poor (major gaps, comprehensive effort needed)
- **< 10**: Critical (start immediately, foundational work)

### Gemba Assessment

**Walk the shop floor** (don't just answer survey):

- Observe actual conditions
- Talk to operators (what's working? what's frustrating?)
- Take photos (before pictures for comparison later)
- Measure (time studies, distance traveled, counts)

**Look for:**
- **Waste**: Waiting, searching, excess motion, defects
- **Safety issues**: Hazards, poor housekeeping, missing PPE
- **Quality problems**: Scrap, rework, customer complaints
- **Bottlenecks**: Where does work pile up?

### Identify Top Priorities

**Don't try to fix everything at once.**

From assessment, identify **3-5 top priorities**:

**Criteria:**
1. **Impact**: Biggest problems (safety, quality, delivery, cost)
2. **Feasibility**: Can achieve quickly (build momentum)
3. **Visibility**: Improvements others can see (builds credibility)

**Example Priorities:**
1. **Safety**: Housekeeping (chips on floor, trip hazards) → immediate
2. **5S**: Tool crib organization (wasting time searching) → quick win
3. **Metrics**: Implement daily OEE tracking (need visibility)
4. **Quality**: First pass yield improvement (high scrap on Part 12345-A)
5. **Standard work**: Document setup procedures (inconsistent setups)

## 23.17.3 Pilot Areas and Quick Wins

**Prove the concept** before rolling out shop-wide.

### Selecting a Pilot Area

**Criteria:**

**1. Contained Scope**
- One work cell, department, or process
- Manageable size (not entire shop at once)

**2. High Visibility**
- Area everyone sees (credibility builder)
- Dramatic transformation potential (before/after impressive)

**3. Willing Participants**
- Supervisor and employees open to change
- Champions (not resisters)

**4. High Impact Potential**

**6. Audit and Sustain**
- Weekly audits (first month)
- Monthly audits (ongoing)
- Address issues immediately (don't let standards slip)

**7. Celebrate and Share**
- Before/after photos (dramatic visual)
- Metrics improvement (time savings, reduced search time)
- Tour for rest of company (see and learn)
- Celebration event (pizza lunch, recognition)

### Quick Wins

**Simultaneously pursue quick wins** (don't wait for pilot to complete):

**Examples:**

**1. Safety Fixes**
- Eliminate tripping hazards (clean up chip piles, secure cords)
- Install PPE dispensers (accessible safety glasses, earplugs)
- Repair broken equipment (damaged guards, loose railings)

**Time**: Days
**Impact**: Immediate (safety, morale)

**2. Visual Management**

- Shadow boards (hand tools, inspection gages)
- Labels and signs (machine names, storage contents)

**Time**: Weeks
**Impact**: Visible, immediate usability

**3. Tool Organization**
- Organize one tool category (e.g., all endmills by size)
- Create shadow board for frequently-used tools
- Label tool crib bins clearly

**Time**: Days
**Impact**: Reduced search time (measurable)

**4. Daily Metrics Board**
- Simple whiteboard with key metrics (parts produced, OEE, quality)
- Updated daily
- Posted in visible location

**Time**: 1 day
**Impact**: Visibility, accountability

**Quick Win Strategy:**
- **Announce**: "30-Day Quick Win Challenge" (create urgency)
- **Empower**: Authorize supervisors to implement (no lengthy approvals)
- **Track**: List all quick wins completed
- **Celebrate**: Recognize each win (positive reinforcement)

## 23.17.4 Change Management

**Technical changes are easy. Cultural changes are hard.**

### Understanding Resistance

**Why People Resist Change:**

**1. Fear of the Unknown**
- Change is uncertain (what will happen to me?)
- Prefer status quo (even if imperfect, it's familiar)

**2. Loss of Control**
- Change imposed (not my choice)
- Feel powerless

**3. Perceived Threat**
- Job security (will I still have a job?)
- Competence (can I learn new ways?)
- Status (will I lose position or respect?)

**4. Past Failures**
- "We tried that before" (cynicism)
- Burned by previous change efforts (lost trust)

**5. Comfort**
- Change requires effort (learning, adapting)
- Inertia (easier to keep doing what we've always done)

**Resistance is normal. Expect it. Address it.**

### Change Management Strategies

**1. Communicate the "Why"**

**People need to understand:**
- **Why change?** (what's the problem? what's the opportunity?)
- **Why now?** (what's the urgency?)
- **What's in it for me?** (how will this benefit me personally?)

**Methods:**
- All-hands meetings (leadership presents vision)
- Small group discussions (supervisor explains to team)
- One-on-one conversations (address individual concerns)

**Repeat often** (people need to hear it multiple times)

**2. Involve People Early**

**Participation reduces resistance:**
- Ask for input (design solutions together)
- Pilot with volunteers (not forced on resisters)
- Form cross-functional teams (diverse perspectives)

**People support what they help create.**

**3. Address Concerns**

**Listen to objections:**
- What are people worried about?
- Are concerns valid? (some may be—address them)
- Are concerns based on misunderstanding? (clarify)

**Acknowledge and respond:**
- "I hear you're concerned about X. Here's how we'll address it..."
- Don't dismiss or ignore (validates feelings)

**4. Provide Support**

**Help people succeed:**
- **Training**: Teach new skills (don't assume people know)
- **Resources**: Provide tools, equipment, time
- **Coaching**: Leaders support, not just demand

**Make it easy to change** (remove barriers)

**5. Show Quick Wins**

**Demonstrate value:**
- Pilot area success (see the results)
- Quick wins (small improvements, fast)
- Data (metrics show improvement)

**Build credibility** (change works)

**6. Recognize and Reward**

**Reinforce desired behavior:**
- Celebrate early adopters (make them heroes)
- Recognize effort (not just results)
- Align incentives (performance reviews, bonuses reflect new priorities)

**What gets rewarded gets repeated.**

**7. Be Patient but Persistent**

**Culture change takes time:**
- Months to see traction
- Years to fully embed

**Don't give up** when enthusiasm wanes (it will)

**Persist:**
- Consistent messaging
- Visible leadership commitment
- Follow through on commitments

### Dealing with Resisters

**Most people will engage eventually.** Some won't.

**Typical Distribution:**
- **Early Adopters** (20%): Embrace change, champion it
- **Majority** (60%): Wait and see, follow when convinced
- **Resisters** (20%): Resist actively or passively

**Strategy:**

**1. Work with Early Adopters**
- Empower them (pilot, leadership roles)
- Use them to influence others

**2. Win Over the Majority**
- Show results (proof)
- Address concerns
- Provide support

**3. Manage Resisters**
- **Understand**: Why are they resisting? (fear, past experience, personality)
- **Engage**: Try to bring them along (one-on-one conversations)
- **Set Expectations**: Change is happening (participation expected)
- **Consequences**: Persistent refusal to participate → performance issue

**Final Option**: Some may choose to leave (and that's OK—better than poisoning culture)

---

## 23.17.6 Sustaining Organizational Excellence

**Starting is easy. Sustaining is hard.**

### Sustaining Strategies

**1. Leadership Consistency**

**Leaders must:**
- **Walk the talk**: Model behaviors (participate in 5S, follow standards)
- **Reinforce regularly**: Gemba walks, meetings, one-on-ones
- **Hold people accountable**: Standards are non-negotiable
- **Provide resources**: Time, budget, support

**If leaders waiver, organization reverts.**

**2. Audits and Accountability**

**Regular audits:**
- 5S audits (weekly or monthly)
- Standard work audits (spot checks)
- Safety audits
- Metric reviews

**Purpose**: Verify compliance, identify issues, reinforce standards

**Accountability:**
- Results posted publicly (transparency)
- Discuss in meetings (address gaps)
- Link to performance reviews (part of job expectations)

**3. Continuous Improvement Culture**

**Never say "we're done":**
- Always improving (kaizen events, suggestions)
- Challenge status quo (is there a better way?)
- Celebrate improvements (reinforce behavior)

**Improvement becomes normal** (not special projects)

**4. Training and Development**

**Ongoing investment:**
- Onboard new employees (organizational excellence training)
- Refresh training (annual or as needed)
- Develop next-generation leaders (succession planning)

**Build capability** (not dependent on individuals)

**5. Metrics and Visibility**

**Track performance:**
- Key metrics visible (daily, weekly)
- Trends analyzed (improving or declining?)
- Act on data (investigate issues, celebrate wins)

**What's measured is managed.**

**6. Engage Employees**

**Keep people involved:**
- Suggestion system active (respond to ideas)
- Improvement projects (participation opportunities)
- Recognition (appreciate contributions)

**Engagement sustains culture.**

### Common Pitfalls

**1. Loss of Leadership Focus**

Crisis or new priority distracts leadership → improvement stalls

**Prevention**: Schedule improvement activities (not "when there's time")

**2. Backsliding on Standards**

5S degrades, standard work not followed, audits stop

**Prevention**: Regular audits, immediate correction, reinforcement

**3. Improvement Fatigue**

Too many projects, people burned out, enthusiasm fades

**Prevention**: Pace sustainably (don't overwhelm), celebrate to maintain energy

**4. Flavor of the Month**

Jump to next program (Six Sigma, Theory of Constraints) before embedding current

**Prevention**: Stick with it (years, not months), integrate new methods (don't replace)

**5. Failure to Adapt**

Business changes (products, volume, customers) but systems don't

**Prevention**: Review and adjust (systems serve the business, not the other way around)
