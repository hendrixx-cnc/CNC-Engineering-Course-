# Module 23 – Shop Organization and Management


## Introduction

**Production planning** determines *what* to produce, *when*, and with *what resources*.

**Scheduling** determines the *specific sequence* and *timing* of jobs through machines and operations.

**The Challenge:**

CNC shops typically face:
- Multiple jobs competing for limited resources
- Varying processing times and complexity
- Rush orders and changing priorities
- Machine breakdowns and tool shortages
- Customer demand variability

**Poor planning and scheduling results in:**
- Missed delivery dates
- Excessive overtime
- Machine idle time (underutilization)
- Excessive WIP inventory
- Employee frustration
- Customer dissatisfaction

**Effective planning and scheduling provides:**
- On-time delivery
- Balanced workload
- Optimal resource utilization
- Predictable lead times
- Lower stress and firefighting

This section covers the fundamentals of production planning and scheduling for CNC manufacturing.

## 23.6.1 Production Planning Fundamentals

### 23.6.1.1 Capacity Planning

**Capacity**: The maximum output a facility can produce in a given time period.

**Types of Capacity:**

**1. Theoretical (Design) Capacity**
- Maximum possible output (24/7, no downtime, perfect efficiency)
- Example: CNC lathe cycle time 5 minutes → 288 parts/day theoretical

**2. Rated (Practical) Capacity**
- Realistic maximum accounting for normal downtime (breaks, maintenance, setup)
- Typically 80-90% of theoretical
- Example: 288 × 0.85 = 245 parts/day rated capacity

**3. Actual Capacity**
- What's actually achieved
- Typically 60-80% of rated (due to inefficiencies, quality issues, delays)
- Example: 245 × 0.70 = 172 parts/day actual

**Goal**: Increase actual capacity toward rated capacity through continuous improvement.

**Calculating Capacity:**

**Machine Capacity Formula:**

```
Capacity (parts/day) = Available Hours × Efficiency
                       ────────────────────────────
                         Cycle Time (hours/part)
```

**Example:**
- Available hours: 16 hours/day (2 shifts)
- Cycle time: 0.25 hours/part (15 minutes)
- Efficiency: 75%

```
Capacity = (16 hours/day × 0.75) / 0.25 hours/part
         = 12 effective hours / 0.25
         = 48 parts/day
```

**Shop Capacity:**

Sum capacity across all machines (accounting for bottlenecks).

**Capacity Planning Steps:**

1. **Calculate Current Capacity**: For each machine/work center
2. **Forecast Demand**: Expected orders over planning period
3. **Compare**: Demand vs. Capacity
4. **Identify Gaps**:
   - **Overcapacity**: Demand < Capacity → underutilization, reduce shifts, or pursue more business
   - **Undercapacity**: Demand > Capacity → need to add capacity or reduce demand

5. **Adjust Capacity**:
   - **Short-term**: Overtime, subcontracting, temporary workers
   - **Long-term**: Add machines, hire staff, add shifts

### 23.6.1.2 Load Balancing

**Load**: Work assigned to a machine or work center

**Balanced Load**: Work distributed evenly across resources

**Problem**: Unbalanced load creates bottlenecks and idle time

**Example: Unbalanced**

| Machine | Hours Available | Hours Loaded | Utilization |
|---------|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| Mill-1  | 40             | 52           | 130% (overloaded) |
| Mill-2  | 40             | 25           | 63% (underutilized) |
| Lathe-1 | 40             | 38           | 95% (good) |

**Issue**: Mill-1 is overloaded (bottleneck), Mill-2 has idle time.

**Solution**: Move 12 hours of work from Mill-1 to Mill-2.

**After Balancing:**

| Machine | Hours Available | Hours Loaded | Utilization |
|---------|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| Mill-1  | 40             | 40           | 100% |
| Mill-2  | 40             | 37           | 93% |
| Lathe-1 | 40             | 38           | 95% |

**Benefits:**
- Mill-1 no longer overloaded (no overtime or delays)
- Mill-2 better utilized
- More balanced flow

**Load Balancing Strategies:**

1. **Flexible Routing**: Parts can be made on multiple machines
   - Design process plans with alternatives
   - Cross-train operators

2. **Job Splitting**: Divide large jobs across multiple machines
   - Run 500 pieces: 250 on Mill-1, 250 on Mill-2

3. **Rescheduling**: Move jobs to later periods (if customer allows)
   - Smooth peak loads over time

4. **Subcontracting**: Send excess work outside
   - Quick solution for temporary overload
   - More expensive, less control

5. **Capacity Addition**: Add shifts, machines, or temporary labor
   - For sustained overload

### 23.6.1.3 Bottleneck Management

**Bottleneck**: Resource with the lowest capacity, limiting overall throughput

**Theory of Constraints (TOC)**: System output is limited by its bottleneck.

**Example:**

```
[Op 10: Saw]     [Op 20: Mill]    [Op 30: Lathe]   [Op 40: Deburr]
Capacity: 100    Capacity: 50     Capacity: 80     Capacity: 100
```

**Bottleneck = Mill (capacity 50)**

No matter how fast other operations are, shop can only produce 50 parts/day.

**Managing Bottlenecks:**

**1. Identify the Bottleneck**
- Highest utilization
- Queue of work always waiting
- Determines system throughput

**2. Exploit the Bottleneck** (Maximize its output)
- No idle time (keep it running continuously)
- Minimize setup time (use SMED)
- Best operators on bottleneck machine
- Preventive maintenance (no breakdowns)
- Buffer inventory before bottleneck (never starve it)

**3. Subordinate Everything to Bottleneck**
- Schedule shop based on bottleneck capacity
- Don't overproduce upstream (creates WIP)
- Downstream operations pace to bottleneck

**4. Elevate the Bottleneck** (Add capacity)
- Overtime on bottleneck machine
- Add second machine (duplicate bottleneck)
- Subcontract bottleneck work
- Improve process (faster cycle time)

**5. Repeat** (New bottleneck emerges)
- Once bottleneck is elevated, another resource becomes new constraint
- Continuous process

**Drum-Buffer-Rope (DBR) Scheduling:**

TOC scheduling method:
- **Drum**: Bottleneck sets pace (like drumbeat)
- **Buffer**: Protective inventory before bottleneck (ensures it never starves)
- **Rope**: Upstream operations tied to bottleneck pace (don't overproduce)

**Result**: Smooth flow, minimal WIP, maximum throughput

## 23.6.2 Scheduling Methods

### 23.6.2.1 Priority Scheduling

**Priority Rules**: Simple heuristics for deciding job sequence

**Common Priority Rules:**

**1. First Come, First Served (FCFS)**
- Jobs scheduled in order received
- **Pros**: Simple, fair
- **Cons**: Ignores urgency, due dates, processing time

**2. Shortest Processing Time (SPT)**
- Jobs with shortest cycle time first
- **Pros**: Minimizes average completion time, high throughput
- **Cons**: Long jobs may wait indefinitely

**3. Earliest Due Date (EDD)**
- Jobs due soonest scheduled first
- **Pros**: Minimizes late jobs
- **Cons**: May not optimize machine utilization

**4. Critical Ratio (CR)**
- Priority based on: (Due Date - Today) / Lead Time Remaining
- CR < 1.0 = Behind schedule (urgent)
- CR = 1.0 = On schedule
- CR > 1.0 = Ahead of schedule
- **Pros**: Dynamic priority (adjusts as time passes)
- **Cons**: Requires accurate lead time estimates

**Example: Critical Ratio**

| Job | Due Date | Days Remaining | Lead Time Needed | Critical Ratio | Priority |
|-----|----------|----------------|------------------|----------------|----------|
| A   | Day 10   | 10             | 5                | 2.0            | Low      |
| B   | Day 8    | 8              | 10               | 0.8            | High     |
| C   | Day 12   | 12             | 12               | 1.0            | Medium   |

**Schedule order: B → C → A**

**5. Customer Priority**
- Important customers scheduled first
- **Pros**: Strategic (keeps key customers happy)
- **Cons**: Other customers may suffer

**Hybrid Approach** (Most Common):
- Start with due date (EDD)
- Apply critical ratio for urgent jobs
- Factor in customer priority
- Consider setup time (group similar setups)

### 23.6.2.2 Critical Ratio Method

**Critical Ratio (CR) = (Due Date - Current Date) / Lead Time Remaining**

**Interpretation:**

| CR Value | Status | Action |
|----------|--------|--------|
| CR > 1.0 | Ahead of schedule | Low priority |
| CR = 1.0 | On schedule | Normal priority |
| CR < 1.0 | Behind schedule | High priority (urgent) |
| CR ≤ 0.5 | Critically late | Expedite immediately |

**Example:**

Today is Day 0.

| Job | Qty | Due Date | Operations Remaining | Hours/Op | Lead Time (hours) | CR | Priority |
|-----|-----|----------|---------------------|----------|-------------------|----|----|
| 101 | 50  | Day 5    | 3 ops               | 4 hrs ea | 12 hours          | (5×8)/12 = 3.3 | 4 (Low) |
| 102 | 20  | Day 3    | 2 ops               | 6 hrs ea | 12 hours          | (3×8)/12 = 2.0 | 3      |
| 103 | 100 | Day 4    | 5 ops               | 5 hrs ea | 25 hours          | (4×8)/25 = 1.3 | 2      |
| 104 | 25  | Day 2    | 3 ops               | 3 hrs ea | 9 hours           | (2×8)/9 = 1.8  | 1 (High) |

**Schedule: 104 → 103 → 102 → 101**

**Benefits:**
- Dynamic (recalculate daily as dates approach)
- Identifies critical jobs
- Balances due date and lead time

**Limitations:**
- Assumes accurate lead time estimates
- Doesn't account for machine availability or setup time

### 23.6.2.3 Theory of Constraints (TOC)

Already covered in 23.6.1.3 (Bottleneck Management).

**TOC Scheduling Principle:**

Schedule the bottleneck first, then schedule everything else around it.

**Steps:**
1. Identify bottleneck (constraint)
2. Schedule bottleneck to maximum utilization
3. Schedule upstream operations to feed bottleneck (don't starve it)
4. Schedule downstream operations to pace bottleneck (don't build WIP)

**Result**: Maximum throughput with minimal WIP.

### 23.6.2.4 Finite Capacity Scheduling (FCS)

**Finite Capacity**: Recognizes real capacity limits

**Infinite Capacity Scheduling** (Naive):
- Assumes unlimited capacity
- Jobs scheduled based on due dates without checking if machines are available
- **Result**: Overloaded machines, impossible schedules

**Finite Capacity Scheduling**:
- Accounts for machine availability, capacity limits, setup time
- Jobs scheduled only when machines are actually available
- **Result**: Realistic, achievable schedules

**FCS Software**:
- Visual scheduling board (digital Gantt chart)
- Drag-and-drop jobs to machines and time slots
- Highlights conflicts (overloads, late jobs)
- Optimizes automatically (algorithms find best sequence)

**Example Tools:**
- JobBOSS, E2 Shop System (ERP with scheduling)
- Schedlyzer, PlanettTogether (advanced scheduling)
- Microsoft Project (basic, not manufacturing-specific)

**Manual Finite Capacity Scheduling:**

Use visual scheduling board (whiteboard or magnetic board):
- Rows = Machines
- Columns = Days or hours
- Cards or magnets = Jobs (size proportional to duration)
- Move cards to available slots

**Benefits:**
- Visual (see entire schedule at a glance)
- Interactive (easy to adjust)
- Realistic (respects capacity)

   - CNC program
   - Setup sheets or work instructions
   - Quality plan

### 23.6.3.2 Job Travelers and Routers

**Job Traveler** (covered in Section 23.5.3): Document that accompanies parts through production.

**Router (Route Sheet)**: Detailed sequence of operations.

**Router Example:**

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ROUTER                                                     │

└────┴────────────────┴──────────┴───────┴────────┴─────────┘
```

**Uses:**
- Estimating (calculate total labor hours)
- Scheduling (know sequence and time requirements)
- Shop floor guidance (operators know what to do)
- Costing (actual time vs. estimated)

### 23.6.3.3 Operation Sequencing

**Sequencing**: Determining the order of operations

**Typical CNC Part Sequence:**

1. **Material Prep**: Saw, cut to size
2. **Roughing**: Remove bulk material
3. **Semi-Finishing**: Closer to final dimensions
4. **Thermal Treatment**: Heat treat, stress relieve (if needed)
5. **Finishing**: Final dimensions and surface finish
6. **Inspection**: Verify dimensions and quality
7. **Secondary Ops**: Deburr, wash, coat, assemble
8. **Final Inspection and Packaging**

**Sequencing Principles:**

**1. Rough Before Finish**
- Heavy cuts first (remove stress, distortion)
- Light finish cuts after (precision, surface finish)

**2. Most Critical Features Last**
- Final operation is most accurate
- Reference surfaces established early

**3. Heat Treatment Between Rough and Finish**
- Relieves stress from roughing
- Finish grind corrects any distortion

**4. Inspect After Critical Operations**
- First article inspection after first complete part
- In-process inspection after critical features
- Final inspection before shipping

**5. Batch Similar Operations**
- If multiple parts need deburring, batch together
- Reduces setups and transitions

---

## 23.6.5 Managing Rush Jobs and Changes

**Reality**: Plans change. Rush orders, customer changes, machine breakdowns happen.

**Challenge**: How to respond without chaos?

### Strategies for Handling Changes

**1. Reserved Capacity**

- Don't schedule to 100% capacity
- Leave 10-20% buffer for rush jobs
- Provides flexibility without overtime

**2. Expedite Procedures**

- Clear process for rush orders
- Who approves? (Manager, customer service)
- How communicated to shop floor? (Red tags, urgent board)
- What gets bumped? (Documented criteria)

**3. Quick Changeover (SMED)**

- Fast setups enable smaller batches
- Easier to insert rush jobs between regular jobs
- Less disruption

**4. Communication Protocol**

- Changes communicated immediately (not at end of shift)
- Visual signals (red flag on schedule board)
- Daily production meetings (adjust schedule)

**5. Prioritization Matrix**

Clear rules for priority conflicts:

| Priority Level | Criteria | Response |
|----------------|----------|----------|
| 1 - Emergency | Customer down, legal liability | Stop everything, expedite |
| 2 - Urgent | Contract penalty, key customer | Bump lower priority if needed |
| 3 - Normal | Standard delivery terms | Schedule normally |
| 4 - Low | Internal, non-critical | Fill gaps in schedule |

**6. Trade-Offs and Negotiation**

- Can't always meet impossible demands
- Negotiate with customer: Later delivery? Partial shipment? Premium cost?
- Honest communication better than false promises

**7. Root Cause Analysis**

- Why are rush jobs frequent?
- Poor planning? Unreliable suppliers? Customer behavior?
- Fix underlying problems (don't just react)

---

## 23.6.6 Production Metrics and Monitoring

**What Gets Measured Gets Managed**

### Key Scheduling Metrics

**1. On-Time Delivery (OTD)**

```
OTD % = (Jobs Delivered On Time / Total Jobs) × 100%
```

**Target**: 95-98%

**2. Schedule Attainment**

```
Schedule Attainment = (Actual Output / Planned Output) × 100%
```

**Target**: 100% (hit the plan)

**3. Lead Time**

```
Lead Time = Ship Date - Order Date
```

Track:
- **Quoted lead time** (what you promise)
- **Actual lead time** (what you deliver)
- **Variance**

**Goal**: Reduce lead time, improve predictability

**4. WIP (Work in Process)**

```
WIP = Number of jobs in progress (or $ value)
```

**Goal**: Minimize (reduces lead time, carrying costs)

**5. Machine Utilization**

```
Utilization % = (Actual Runtime / Available Time) × 100%
```

**Target**: 70-85% (allows for setups, maintenance, flexibility)
**Note**: 100% utilization often indicates overload (no buffer)

**6. Schedule Changes**

```
Schedule Stability = 1 - (Jobs Changed / Total Jobs)
```

**Goal**: Minimize changes (stable schedule is efficient schedule)

**7. Late Jobs (Backlog)**

Count of jobs past due date

**Goal**: Zero or near-zero

### Visual Metric Boards

Post metrics on shop floor:
- Daily or weekly updates
- Trend charts (improving or declining?)
- Color-coded (green = good, yellow = caution, red = problem)
- Action items (what are we doing to improve?)

**Example Metrics Board:**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   PRODUCTION METRICS - Week 23           │
├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ On-Time Delivery:  94%  [Yellow]  ↓     │
│   Target: 95%                            │
│   Action: Focus on Job 456 & 789        │
├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Schedule Attainment: 98%  [Green]  ↑    │
│   Target: 100%                           │
├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Late Jobs: 3   [Yellow]                  │
│   Job 456 (2 days late)                  │
│   Job 789 (1 day late)                   │
│   Job 802 (4 days late)                  │
├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Machine Utilization:                     │
│   Mill-1:  87%  [Green]                  │
│   Mill-2:  65%  [Yellow] (underutilized) │
│   Lathe-1: 92%  [Green]                  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Summary

Production planning and scheduling are critical to CNC shop success. Effective planning balances capacity with demand, identifies and manages bottlenecks, and distributes work evenly across resources.

Scheduling methods range from simple priority rules (FCFS, EDD, SPT) to sophisticated techniques (Critical Ratio, Theory of Constraints, Finite Capacity Scheduling). Visual scheduling boards—physical or digital—provide transparency and enable quick adjustments.

Managing the inevitable changes (rush jobs, breakdowns, customer changes) requires reserved capacity, clear procedures, and communication. Tracking key metrics (on-time delivery, schedule attainment, utilization) drives continuous improvement.

Good planning and scheduling turn chaos into predictability, delivering better results for customers, employees, and the business.

In the next section, we'll explore inventory management—controlling raw materials, WIP, and finished goods to balance availability with cost.
