# Module 23 – Shop Organization and Management


## Introduction

**Preventive Maintenance (PM)**: Scheduled maintenance performed to prevent breakdowns and extend equipment life.

**The Problem with Reactive Maintenance:**

**Reactive (Run to Failure)** approach:
- Wait until machine breaks down
- Emergency repair required
- **Result**: Unplanned downtime, production delays, expensive expedited parts, overtime, frustrated customers

**Costs of Reactive Maintenance:**
- **Production losses**: Machine down, can't make parts
- **Emergency repair costs**: After-hours labor, expedited shipping, premium parts
- **Collateral damage**: One failed component damages others (bearing failure damages spindle)
- **Unpredictability**: Don't know when failures will occur
- **Quality issues**: Degrading equipment produces poor-quality parts

**Benefits of Preventive Maintenance:**
- **Reduced downtime**: Scheduled maintenance avoids unexpected failures
- **Lower repair costs**: Catch problems early (oil change vs. engine replacement)
- **Extended equipment life**: Well-maintained machines last longer
- **Better quality**: Properly maintained machines hold tolerances
- **Predictability**: Planned maintenance scheduled during non-production time
- **Safety**: Reduce accidents from equipment failure

**The Goal**: Transition from reactive firefighting to proactive, organized maintenance that keeps equipment reliable.

**This section covers:**
- Planned maintenance systems
- Autonomous maintenance
- Spare parts management
- Maintenance tool organization
- Maintenance metrics (MTBF, MTTR)
- Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS)

## 23.11.1 Planned Maintenance Systems

**Planned Maintenance**: Systematic approach to maintaining equipment.

### 23.11.1.1 Maintenance Scheduling

**Types of Maintenance Schedules:**

**1. Time-Based Maintenance**

Perform tasks at fixed intervals:
- **Daily**: Cleaning, lubrication checks, visual inspection
- **Weekly**: Fluid level checks, filter inspection
- **Monthly**: Detailed cleaning, lubrication, adjustments
- **Quarterly**: Comprehensive inspection, wear part replacement
- **Annually**: Major overhaul, calibration, alignment

**Example: CNC Lathe Time-Based PM**

| Frequency | Tasks |
|-----------|-------|
| **Daily** | - Wipe down machine<br>- Check coolant level<br>- Empty chip conveyor<br>- Visual inspection (leaks, unusual sounds) |
| **Weekly** | - Check hydraulic oil level<br>- Inspect way covers<br>- Lubricate way system<br>- Check air pressure |
| **Monthly** | - Clean coolant tank, replace coolant<br>- Inspect/clean filters (hydraulic, coolant, air)<br>- Check tool changer operation<br>- Lubricate spindle (if manual) |
| **Quarterly** | - Inspect drive belts (wear, tension)<br>- Check spindle bearings (listen for noise)<br>- Inspect electrical connections<br>- Update machine hour meter reading |
| **Annually** | - Spindle alignment and runout check<br>- Check backlash on ball screws<br>- Replace way system wipers<br>- Professional inspection (if available) |

**2. Usage-Based Maintenance**

Perform tasks based on hours of operation or cycles:
- Every 500 machine hours: Change hydraulic filter
- Every 1,000 hours: Grease ball screws
- Every 2,000 hours: Replace spindle coolant pump

**Requires**: Hour meter or cycle counter on machine

**Benefit**: Maintenance frequency matches actual wear (not arbitrary calendar)

**3. Condition-Based Maintenance**

Monitor equipment condition, perform maintenance when indicators suggest:
- Vibration analysis (bearings wearing?)
- Oil analysis (contamination, breakdown?)
- Temperature monitoring (overheating?)
- Visual inspection (wear, leaks)

**Example**: Bearing vibration increasing → schedule bearing replacement before failure

**Advanced**: Requires instrumentation (sensors) and expertise

**Hybrid Approach** (Most Practical):

- **Daily/Weekly**: Time-based (simple, done by operators)
- **Monthly/Quarterly**: Time-based (done by maintenance)
- **Major Components**: Usage-based (tied to machine hours)
- **Critical Equipment**: Condition-based (monitor for early warning)

### 23.11.1.2 Maintenance Checklists

**Checklist**: Step-by-step list of tasks to perform during maintenance.

**Purpose:**
- Ensure nothing is forgotten
- Standardize maintenance (consistent across shifts/people)
- Training aid (new maintenance staff)
- Record keeping (sign off when complete)

**Example: Monthly PM Checklist - CNC Mill**

**Checklist Design Best Practices:**

1. **Specific**: Clear, actionable items (not vague)
   - Good: "Replace hydraulic filter (P/N 12345)"
   - Poor: "Check hydraulics"

2. **Sequential**: Logical order (top to bottom, front to back)

3. **Checkbox**: Each item gets checked off (visual progress)

4. **Space for Notes**: Record observations, issues found

5. **Sign-Off**: Technician signs and dates (accountability)

### 23.11.1.3 Maintenance Records

**Maintenance History**: Record of all maintenance performed on each machine.

**Why Keep Records?**

1. **Track Compliance**: Verify PM performed on schedule
2. **Troubleshooting**: Review history when problems occur (patterns?)
3. **Cost Tracking**: How much is this machine costing to maintain?
4. **Decision-Making**: Repair or replace? (history informs decision)
5. **Warranty**: Some warranties require documented maintenance
6. **Audit**: ISO 9001, AS9100 require maintenance records

**What to Record:**

- Date of maintenance
- Type of maintenance (daily, monthly, annual, repair)
- Tasks performed (checklist)
- Parts replaced (part numbers, quantities)
- Labor hours
- Cost (parts + labor)
- Technician name
- Issues found and resolved
- Machine hours at time of maintenance

**Record Systems:**

**1. Paper Logbook (Basic)**

- Binder for each machine
- PM checklists filed chronologically
- Repair work orders filed
- **Pros**: Simple, low-cost
- **Cons**: Hard to search, easy to lose

**2. Spreadsheet (Intermediate)**

- Excel file for each machine (or master sheet)
- Rows = maintenance events
- Columns = date, type, tasks, cost, notes
- **Pros**: Searchable, can calculate totals
- **Cons**: Manual data entry, no automated alerts

**3. CMMS (Advanced)**

Computerized Maintenance Management System (covered in 23.11.6)
- Database tracks all equipment and maintenance
- Automated scheduling and alerts
- History reports, cost analysis
- **Pros**: Comprehensive, automated
- **Cons**: Cost, implementation effort

---

## 23.11.2 Autonomous Maintenance

**Autonomous Maintenance**: Operators perform basic maintenance on their own equipment.

**Philosophy**: Operators, not just maintenance, care for machines.

**Origin**: Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), Toyota

### 23.11.2.1 Operator-Performed Maintenance

**Tasks Appropriate for Operators:**

**Level 1: Basic Cleaning and Inspection**
- Wipe down machine daily
- Clean chip buildup
- Check coolant level, top off
- Visual inspection (leaks, loose bolts, unusual sounds)

**Level 2: Routine Lubrication**
- Grease fittings (if manual)
- Oil way covers (if manual system)

**Level 3: Simple Adjustments**
- Adjust coolant nozzle position
- Tighten loose guards or covers
- Clean filters (air, coolant screen)

**Level 4: Minor Repairs** (if trained)
- Replace way wipers
- Replace coolant pump (if simple)
- Change air filter

**NOT Operator Tasks** (require maintenance expertise):
- Spindle work
- Ball screw or linear guide service
- Hydraulic or pneumatic system repair
- Electrical troubleshooting
- Alignment and calibration

### 23.11.2.2 Daily Inspection Routines

**Start-of-Shift Inspection** (5 minutes):

Operator checks machine before starting production:

1. **Visual Inspection**
   - Any leaks? (oil, coolant, hydraulic)
   - Any damage? (broken guards, covers)
   - Any unusual sounds? (listen during warmup)

2. **Fluid Levels**
   - Coolant (top off if low)
   - Hydraulic oil (check sight glass)
   - Lubrication reservoir (auto-lube system)

3. **Cleanliness**
   - Chip conveyor clear?
   - Coolant tank clean? (no tramp oil, debris)
   - Machine surfaces clean?

4. **Function Test**
   - Cycle power on (watch for error messages)
   - Manual jog (X, Y, Z axes—smooth motion?)
   - Spindle start/stop (smooth, no vibration?)
   - Tool changer (cycle through tools—no issues?)

**End-of-Shift Routine** (10 minutes):

1. **Cleaning**
   - Wipe down machine
   - Empty chip conveyor
   - Clean coolant trays

2. **Inspection**
   - Any issues during shift? (report to maintenance)
   - Any tools or fixturing left on machine? (remove)

3. **Preparation**
   - Machine ready for next shift (clean, organized)

**Documentation:**

Simple checklist or logbook:
- Operator initials daily
- Note any issues found

### 23.11.2.3 Basic Cleaning and Lubrication

**Cleaning:**

**Why Clean?**
- Cleaning = inspection (discover leaks, cracks, wear during cleaning)
- Prevent contamination (chips in ways, coolant systems)
- Extend life (grit causes wear)

**Daily Cleaning Tasks:**
- Wipe exterior surfaces
- Remove chip buildup (especially ways, ways covers)
- Clean coolant tank skimmer (remove floating oil/chips)

**Monthly Cleaning Tasks:**
- Deep clean coolant tank (drain, scrub, refill)
- Clean machine interior (open doors, vacuum/blow out chips)
- Clean control panel (dust, oil film)

**Lubrication:**

**Why Lubricate?**
- Reduce friction and wear
- Prevent rust/corrosion
- Extend component life

**Auto-Lube Systems:**
- Most modern CNC machines have automatic lubrication
- Operator responsibility: **Check reservoir level, top off**
- System delivers lube to ways, ball screws automatically on schedule

**Manual Grease Points:**
- Some machines have manual grease fittings
- Use grease gun to apply grease (per PM schedule)
- Don't over-grease (can damage seals)

**Training:**
- Operators need training on what, when, how to lubricate
- Refer to machine manual (lubrication chart)

---

## 23.11.3 Spare Parts Management

**Spare Parts**: Replacement parts kept in stock for maintenance and repairs.

**Challenge**: Which parts to stock? How many?

**Too Few Spares:**
- Machine down waiting for parts (production loss)
- Emergency shipping (expensive)

**Too Many Spares:**
- Cash tied up in inventory
- Parts obsolete or deteriorate
- Storage space consumed

### 23.11.3.1 Critical Spare Parts Inventory

**Identify Critical Parts:**

**Criteria:**
1. **Failure Impact**: Downtime cost (high-volume machines = higher impact)
2. **Failure Probability**: How likely to fail? (wear items more likely)
3. **Lead Time**: How long to get from supplier? (long lead = stock)
4. **Cost**: Inexpensive to stock (vs. cost of downtime)

**Classification:**

**Class A: Critical—Must Stock**
- High failure probability
- Long lead time
- High downtime impact
- **Example**: Spindle bearings, drive belts, coolant pump

**Class B: Important—Consider Stocking**
- Moderate failure probability
- Moderate lead time
- Moderate impact
- **Example**: Hydraulic filters, way wipers, seals

**Class C: Non-Critical—Order as Needed**
- Low failure probability
- Short lead time (readily available)
- Low impact (or can use alternate machine)
- **Example**: Knobs, cosmetic parts, low-use accessories

**Minimum Stock Levels:**

- **Class A**: 1-2 units (or more for consumables)
- **Class B**: 1 unit (if space and budget allow)
- **Class C**: 0 (order when needed)

**Example: CNC Lathe Critical Spares**

| Part | Class | Stock Level | Reason |
|------|-------|-------------|--------|
| Spindle belts | A | 2 sets | Wear item, machine down without it |
| Coolant pump | A | 1 | Failure common, hard to get same-day |
| Hydraulic filter | B | 2 | Scheduled replacement, cheap |
| Way wipers | B | 1 set | Wear item, but can run short-term without |
| Control panel cover | C | 0 | Rarely broken, cosmetic |

### 23.11.3.2 Parts Kitting for Maintenance

**Maintenance Kit**: Pre-assembled parts for specific PM tasks.

**Example: Annual PM Kit for CNC Mill**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ANNUAL PM KIT - Haas VF-4                   │
│ Part #: PM-KIT-VF4-ANNUAL                    │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Contents:                                    │
│ - (1) Hydraulic filter (P/N 12-3456)        │
│ - (1) Air filter (P/N 23-4567)              │
│ - (4) Way wipers (P/N 34-5678)              │
│ - (1) Grease cartridge (P/N 45-6789)        │
│ - (1) Coolant additive (P/N 56-7890)        │
│ - Annual PM checklist                        │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Benefits:**
- All parts ready (no searching during PM)
- Consistent (don't forget items)
- Efficient (one purchase order, one inventory item)
- Easy ordering (reorder "Annual PM Kit")

**Create Kits For:**
- Scheduled PM intervals (monthly, quarterly, annual)
- Common repairs (spindle rebuild, tool changer service)

### 23.11.3.3 Supplier Relationships

**Maintain Good Relationships with Parts Suppliers:**

**Why:**
- Faster response when emergency arises
- Better pricing (loyal customer)
- Technical support (help troubleshooting)
- Advance notice (parts becoming obsolete)

**Preferred Supplier Strategy:**
- Consolidate purchases with 1-2 suppliers (vs. many)
- Negotiate pricing and terms
- Establish account (credit terms, online ordering)

**Local Distributor** (if available):
- Same-day or next-day delivery
- Worth slightly higher price vs. waiting days for shipment

**OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer):**
- For critical or specialized parts (guaranteed fit)
- Often more expensive, but reliable

**Aftermarket Suppliers:**
- For commodity parts (filters, belts, bearings)
- Often cheaper than OEM
- Verify quality (reputable brands)

---

## 23.11.4 Maintenance Tool Organization

**Maintenance Tools**: Specialized tools for servicing equipment.

### Tool Storage and Organization

**Dedicated Maintenance Tool Storage:**

Not mixed with production tooling—separate area or cabinet.

**Organization Methods:**

**1. Tool Cabinets**
- Roll-around cabinet (like mechanic's toolbox)
- Drawers organized by tool type
- Each tool has designated spot (foam cutouts, shadow board)

**2. Wall-Mounted Storage**
- Pegboard or shadow board
- Larger tools hung (wrenches, hammers, pry bars)
- Visual—see missing tools instantly

**3. Tool Kits**
- Portable kit for machine-side service
- Essential tools for quick fixes
- Returns to storage when done

**Label and Organize:**

- By tool type: Wrenches, sockets, screwdrivers, specialty tools
- By size: Within each type, organize by size
- Shadow boards: Outline of each tool (missing tools obvious)

**Common Maintenance Tools:**

**General:**
- Metric and imperial wrench sets (common CNC fasteners)
- Socket sets (1/4", 3/8", 1/2" drive)
- Screwdriver sets (Phillips, flat, Torx)
- Hex key (Allen wrench) sets
- Pliers (needle-nose, slip-joint, locking)
- Hammers (dead-blow, ball-peen)

**Specialty:**
- Torque wrenches (proper tightening)
- Grease gun and cartridges
- Oil cans and lubrication supplies
- Pry bars (for moving heavy components)
- Inspection mirrors and flashlights
- Dial indicators and test indicators
- Multimeter (electrical troubleshooting)

**Machine-Specific:**
- Specialized wrenches (spindle wrenches, way covers)
- Alignment tools (laser alignment, precision levels)
- Spare fuses and relays

**Tool Control:**

- **Check-out system** (if tools leave maintenance area)
- **Inventory**: Periodic check (all tools present?)
- **Replacement**: Worn or broken tools replaced promptly
- **Calibration**: Torque wrenches calibrated annually

---

## 23.11.5 Maintenance Metrics (MTBF, MTTR)

**Metrics**: Measure maintenance effectiveness and equipment reliability.

### Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)

**MTBF**: Average time equipment operates before failing.

**Formula:**

```
         Total Operating Time
MTBF = ─────────────────────────
        Number of Failures
```

**Example:**

Machine ran 2,000 hours with 4 failures:

```
MTBF = 2,000 hours / 4 failures = 500 hours
```

**Interpretation**: On average, machine runs 500 hours before a failure.

**Goal**: **Increase MTBF** (longer time between failures = more reliable)

**How to Improve MTBF:**
- Better preventive maintenance (catch problems early)
- Replace wear parts before failure
- Upgrade components (better quality)
- Improve operating conditions (proper use, good housekeeping)

**Benchmarking:**
- Compare machines (which is most reliable?)
- Track over time (improving or declining?)

### Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)

**MTTR**: Average time to repair equipment after failure.

**Formula:**

```
         Total Repair Time
MTTR = ────────────────────
        Number of Repairs
```

**Example:**

4 repairs took 2, 4, 3, and 3 hours:

```
MTTR = (2 + 4 + 3 + 3) hours / 4 repairs = 12 / 4 = 3 hours
```

**Interpretation**: Average repair takes 3 hours.

**Goal**: **Reduce MTTR** (faster repairs = less downtime)

**How to Improve MTTR:**
- **Spare parts on hand** (don't wait for shipping)
- **Trained technicians** (fast diagnosis and repair)
- **Good documentation** (manuals, schematics accessible)
- **Tool availability** (right tools ready)
- **Root cause analysis** (fix problem correctly first time, not repeat)

### Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)

**OEE**: Composite metric measuring equipment performance.

**Formula:**

```
OEE = Availability × Performance × Quality
```

**Where:**
- **Availability**: % of scheduled time machine is available (not down)
  ```
  Availability = (Scheduled Time - Downtime) / Scheduled Time
  ```

- **Performance**: % of maximum speed (cycle time vs. ideal)
  ```
  Performance = Ideal Cycle Time / Actual Cycle Time
  ```

- **Quality**: % of parts that are good (not scrap/rework)
  ```
  Quality = Good Parts / Total Parts
  ```

**Example:**

- Availability: 90% (10% downtime)
- Performance: 85% (slower than ideal)
- Quality: 95% (5% scrap)

```
OEE = 0.90 × 0.85 × 0.95 = 0.728 = 72.8%
```

**World-Class OEE**: 85%+

**Use OEE to:**
- Identify improvement opportunities (which factor is weakest?)
- Track improvement over time
- Compare machines or facilities

**Maintenance Impact on OEE:**

- **Availability**: PM reduces downtime → improves availability
- **Performance**: Well-maintained machines run at rated speed → improves performance
- **Quality**: Machines in good condition hold tolerances → improves quality

**Good maintenance improves all three factors.**
