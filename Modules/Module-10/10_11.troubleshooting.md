# Module 10 – Robotic Arm


Systematic troubleshooting minimizes downtime and identifies root causes. This section covers common problems, diagnostic procedures, and solutions.

## Systematic Approach

### Troubleshooting Methodology

**1. Gather Information**
- What is the symptom?
- When did it start?
- What changed recently?
- Is it constant or intermittent?
- Any error codes or alarms?

**2. Verify the Problem**
- Reproduce the issue
- Note exact conditions
- Document error messages
- Capture screenshots or videos

**3. Check Obvious Causes**
- Emergency stop engaged?
- Safety devices triggered?
- Power supply issues?
- Correct operating mode?

**4. Isolate the Subsystem**
- Mechanical, electrical, or software?
- Specific joint or axis?
- Controller, drive, or motor?

**5. Form Hypothesis**
- List possible causes (most to least likely)
- Based on symptoms and experience

**6. Test Hypothesis**
- Make one change at a time
- Verify result before proceeding
- Use measurements, not assumptions

**7. Implement Solution**
- Fix root cause, not symptoms
- Verify complete resolution
- Document solution and preventive measures

## Motion and Positioning Issues

### Robot Does Not Move

**Symptom**: No motion when commanded

**Check List**

1. **Emergency Stop**
   - Is e-stop pressed?
   - Reset and verify release
   - Check all e-stops in system

2. **Operating Mode**
   - Correct mode selected (Auto/Manual)?
   - Enabling device active (if manual mode)?
   - Mode selector key switch position

3. **Safety Circuits**
   - Are all guards closed?
   - Light curtains clear?
   - Safety relay status
   - Check safety circuit wiring

4. **Controller Status**
   - Controller powered on?
   - No fault codes displayed?
   - Motors enabled?
   - Servo drives ready (LED indicators)

5. **Motor Power**
   - Main contactor energized?
   - Drive enable signal present?
   - Check drive fault LEDs
   - Measure motor supply voltage

6. **Software Limits**
   - Position within software limits?
   - Check limit status in controller
   - Jog away from limit if at boundary

**Diagnostic Procedure**
```
1. Press e-stop, release, observe behavior
   - No change: E-stop circuit issue

2. Check controller display for faults
   - Drive fault: Investigate specific drive
   - Communication fault: Check cables

3. Manually jog single joint (if possible)
   - Works: Program or command issue
   - Fails: Hardware problem

4. Monitor drive enable signal (oscilloscope/multimeter)
   - Not present: Controller or safety circuit
   - Present but no motion: Drive or motor fault
```

### Positioning Errors

**Symptom**: Robot doesn't reach commanded position accurately

**Possible Causes**

1. **Calibration Drift**
   - Check: Move to known taught position, measure deviation
   - Solution: Re-calibrate TCP or re-master joints
   - Preventive: Regular calibration checks

2. **Encoder Issues**
   - Check: Encoder signal quality (oscilloscope)
   - Symptoms: Erratic positioning, intermittent errors
   - Solution: Re-align or replace encoder
   - Check encoder cable integrity

3. **Mechanical Backlash**
   - Check: Reverse direction, measure position change
   - Sources: Belt stretch, gear wear, loose couplings
   - Solution: Tighten belts, replace worn gears, adjust preload

4. **Gearbox Wear**
   - Check: Measure backlash at output
   - Harmonic drive: <1 arcmin acceptable, >3 arcmin replace
   - Planetary: <5 arcmin acceptable
   - Solution: Replace or rebuild gearbox

5. **Structural Deflection**
   - Check: Position error correlates with payload or orientation
   - Measure: Use dial indicator under load
   - Solution: Reduce payload, reinforce structure, or accept limitation

6. **Thermal Expansion**
   - Check: Worse after warmup?
   - Measure: Position when cold vs. hot
   - Solution: Allow warmup period, temperature compensation

**Diagnostic Test**

Repeatability Test:
1. Move to target position 20 times
2. Measure position each time
3. Calculate standard deviation
4. Repeatability should be <0.05 mm for most robots

If repeatable but inaccurate:
- Calibration issue
- Kinematic parameter error

If not repeatable:
- Mechanical looseness
- Encoder problems
- Backlash

### Erratic Motion or Vibration

**Symptom**: Robot shakes, oscillates, or moves roughly

**Possible Causes**

1. **Control Tuning**
   - PID gains too high
   - Check: Reduce proportional and derivative gains
   - Tune: Start low, increase gradually
   - Use auto-tune if available

2. **Mechanical Resonance**
   - Structure vibrates at specific frequency
   - Check: Occurs at certain speeds or positions?
   - Solution: Change acceleration, add damping, adjust gains

3. **Encoder Noise**
   - Electrical interference
   - Check: Encoder signals with oscilloscope
   - Solution: Shield cables, separate from power, ground properly

4. **Loose Components**
   - Bolts, couplings, bearings
   - Check: Inspect and torque all fasteners
   - Listen: Rattle or clicking indicates looseness

5. **Worn Bearings**
   - Check: Roughness when manually rotating joint
   - Listen: Grinding noise
   - Feel: Excessive play
   - Solution: Replace bearings

6. **Belt Issues**
   - Too loose: Vibration, tooth jumping
   - Too tight: Excessive bearing load, motor strain
   - Check: Belt tension (1-2% deflection)
   - Solution: Adjust tensioner

**Diagnostic Procedure**

Isolate Affected Joint:
1. Move only one joint at a time
2. Identify which joint(s) vibrate
3. Vary speed and acceleration
4. Note when vibration occurs

Test with No Load:
- Remove tool or payload
- If vibration stops: Inertia or balance issue
- If continues: Internal robot problem

### Following Error Alarms

**Symptom**: Position error exceeds limit, robot stops

**Causes**

1. **Excessive Load**
   - Payload beyond capacity
   - Friction or binding

   - Solution: Reduce acceleration in program

3. **Servo Drive Fault**
   - Insufficient torque output
   - Check: Drive status LEDs, error codes
   - Test: Swap drive with known good

4. **Encoder Problems**
   - Skipped counts, poor signals
   - Check: Signal quality
   - Solution: Replace encoder or cable

5. **Gearbox Binding**
   - Damaged gears, lack of lubrication
   - Check: Motor current (high indicates resistance)
   - Listen: Grinding noise
   - Solution: Service or replace gearbox
