# Module 23 – Shop Organization and Management


## Introduction

**Manufacturing is a team sport.** Success requires coordination, communication, and collaboration across the organization.

**The Challenge:**

CNC shops are complex environments:
- Multiple shifts operating different hours
- Diverse roles (operators, programmers, inspectors, maintenance, supervisors)
- Handoffs between shifts and departments
- Time-sensitive decisions requiring input from multiple people
- Problems requiring cross-functional problem-solving

**Poor communication and organization result in:**
- Miscommunication and errors
- Duplicated effort or dropped tasks
- Slow decision-making
- Finger-pointing and blame
- Low morale and engagement
- Customer issues (from internal confusion)

**Effective team organization and communication enable:**
- Clear roles and responsibilities
- Smooth handoffs and coordination
- Fast problem-solving
- Engaged, empowered employees
- Consistent customer experience

**This section covers:**
- Organizational structure (functional vs. cell-based)
- Roles and responsibilities
- Shift handoff procedures
- Daily stand-up meetings
- Problem escalation procedures
- Employee suggestion systems
- Team-based problem solving

## 23.14.1 Organizational Structure

**Organizational structure** defines reporting relationships and how work is organized.

### 23.14.1.1 Functional vs. Cell-Based Organization

**Functional Organization** (Traditional)

**Structure:**
- Organized by function or department
- All similar machines/skills grouped together

**Example:**
```
        Shop Manager
             |
    ┌────────┼────────┐
    |        |        |
  Milling  Turning  Grinding
  Supervisor Supervisor Supervisor
    |        |        |
  Operators Operators Operators
```

**Characteristics:**
- Parts move between departments
- Specialized supervisors (expert in one process)
- Operators focus on one type of machine
- Work assigned by department

**Advantages:**
- **Specialization**: Deep expertise in each area
- **Flexibility**: Any operator can run any job in their department
- **Equipment utilization**: Share machines across many jobs
- **Supervision**: Supervisor expert in the process

**Disadvantages:**
- **Handoffs**: Parts move between departments (coordination needed)
- **Queues**: Work piles up between departments (long lead times)
- **Accountability**: Who owns the complete part? (not clear)
- **Communication**: Requires coordination across departments

**Best for:**
- Job shops (high variety, low volume)
- Highly specialized equipment
- Diverse product mix with different routings

**Cell-Based Organization** (Lean)

**Structure:**
- Organized by product family or customer
- Cells contain all operations needed for a product

**Example:**
```
        Shop Manager
             |
    ┌────────┼────────┐
    |        |        |
  Cell 1   Cell 2   Cell 3
  Leader   Leader   Leader
    |        |        |
(Mill, Lathe, (Mill, Grind, (Lathe, Drill,
 Inspect)    Inspect)      Inspect)
    |        |        |
Cross-trained  Cross-trained  Cross-trained
Operators     Operators     Operators
```

**Characteristics:**
- Cell contains machines for a product family (e.g., "Bracket Cell")
- Operators cross-trained on all machines in cell
- One team owns the complete product
- Minimal handoffs

**Advantages:**
- **Flow**: Parts flow smoothly through cell (short lead time)
- **Accountability**: Cell owns the product (clear responsibility)
- **Communication**: Team works together daily (easy coordination)
- **Quality**: Team sees entire process (catch problems early)
- **Engagement**: Team ownership and pride

**Disadvantages:**
- **Equipment duplication**: May need similar machines in multiple cells
- **Flexibility**: Cell dedicated to specific products (less flexible)
- **Training**: Operators need broader skills (more training required)

**Best for:**
- Repetitive production (product families)
- High volume or focused factories
- Desire for short lead times and high quality
- Lean manufacturing implementation

- **R**esponsible: Does the work
- **A**ccountable: Owns the outcome (one person only)
- **C**onsulted: Provides input
- **I**nformed: Kept in the loop

**Example RACI for "First Article Inspection":**

| Role | RACI |
|------|------|
| Operator | R (performs inspection) |
| Inspector | C (verifies critical features) |
| Supervisor | A (accountable for approval) |
| Programmer | I (informed of results) |

### 23.14.1.3 Cross-Training and Flexibility

**Cross-Training**: Teaching employees skills beyond their primary role.

**Benefits:**

**1. Flexibility**
- Cover absences (vacation, sick)
- Balance workload (move people to bottlenecks)
- Handle demand variability

**2. Engagement**
- Variety (not doing same task every day)
- Learning and development
- Career growth opportunities

**3. Quality**
- Understand upstream and downstream processes
- Better problem-solving (broader perspective)

**4. Efficiency**
- One person can perform multiple operations (reduce handoffs)
- Cell-based manufacturing (operators run multiple machines)

**Cross-Training Strategy:**

**1. Skills Matrix**

Visual chart showing who is trained on what:

```
┌──────────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┐
│ Employee     │ Mill-1 │ Lathe-1│ Grind-1│ Inspect│
├──────────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┤
│ John Smith   │   ●    │   ◐    │        │   ○    │
│ Jane Doe     │   ◐    │   ●    │   ○    │   ●    │
│ Mike Johnson │   ●    │   ●    │   ●    │   ◐    │
│ Sarah Lee    │   ○    │   ◐    │   ●    │   ●    │
└──────────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┘

Legend:
● = Fully proficient (can train others)
◐ = Competent (can work independently)
○ = Learning (requires supervision)
  = Not trained
```

**2. Training Plan**
- Identify gaps (which skills are thin?)
- Prioritize (which cross-training most valuable?)
- Schedule training (balance production needs)
- Track progress (update skills matrix)

**3. Compensation**
- Pay for skills (incentive to learn)
- Example: Base rate + $1/hr for each additional skill

**4. Sustainment**
- Use it or lose it (rotate through skills periodically)
- Refresher training as needed

## 23.14.2 Shift Handoff Procedures

**Shift Handoff**: Communication between outgoing and incoming shifts.

**Why Critical:**

- **Continuity**: Ensure incoming shift knows status and priorities
- **Avoid mistakes**: Don't repeat errors or miss critical info
- **Efficiency**: Incoming shift starts productive immediately (not searching for info)

**Poor Handoff:**
- Outgoing shift leaves (no communication)
- Incoming shift discovers problems (surprise!)
- Time wasted figuring out what was happening
- Errors repeated

**Good Handoff:**
- Clear communication (written and verbal)
- Status known (what's done, what's in progress, what's next)
- Problems documented (issues encountered, troubleshooting attempted)
- Smooth transition

### Shift Handoff Process

**1. Shift Handoff Log (Written)**

**Logbook or digital form** with:
- Date and shift
- Machine/area status
- Jobs in progress (status, location)
- Jobs completed
- Problems or issues (description, actions taken)
- Priorities for next shift
- Notes (anything unusual or important)

**Example Shift Handoff Log:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ SHIFT HANDOFF LOG - Mill-1                         │
│ Date: 1/24/25    Shift: Day (6am-2pm)              │
│ Outgoing Operator: John Smith                      │
│ Incoming Operator: Jane Doe                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ JOBS COMPLETED:                                     │

│   All parts inspected and packaged.                │
│                                                     │
│ JOBS IN PROGRESS:                                   │
│ - Job 2025-048 (Housing 67890-B): 15 of 25 complete│
│   Setup complete, running smoothly.                │
│   Material for remaining 10 pcs staged at machine. │
│                                                     │
│ ISSUES / PROBLEMS:                                  │
│ - Coolant pump making unusual noise (still works)  │
│   Maintenance notified, will inspect tomorrow.     │
│ - Tool T05 (3/8" endmill) wearing faster than      │
│   expected. Replaced after 30 parts (normal: 50).  │
│   New tool installed, offsets verified.            │
│                                                     │
│ PRIORITIES FOR NEXT SHIFT:                          │
│ - Complete Job 2025-048 (10 pcs remaining)         │
│ - Start Job 2025-050 (Shaft, setup required)       │
│                                                     │
│ NOTES:                                              │
│ - Supervisor requested daily production report     │
│   (see clipboard by door).                         │
│                                                     │
│ Outgoing Signature: _______________ Time: _____    │
│ Incoming Signature: _______________ Time: _____    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**2. Face-to-Face Handoff (Verbal)**

**Brief meeting** (5-10 minutes) between outgoing and incoming:
- Walk through log (highlight key points)
- Show current job status (physically at machine)
- Answer questions
- Ensure understanding

**Overlap Shift** (if possible):
- 15-30 minutes of overlap (outgoing and incoming both present)
- Allows time for handoff without rushing
- Outgoing available for questions

**3. Supervisor Review**

Supervisor reviews logs:
- Aware of issues and priorities
- Follow up on problems
- Verify handoff occurred

### Digital Shift Handoff

**Modern approach**: Digital log (tablet, MES system)

**Benefits:**
- Accessible from anywhere (remote supervision)
- Searchable (find past issues quickly)
- Linked to jobs, machines (organized automatically)
- Alerts (flag critical issues for management)

**Example:** Shop floor tablet with handoff app
- Outgoing shift completes form
- Incoming shift acknowledges receipt
- Supervisor receives notification of any red flags

---

## 23.14.3 Daily Stand-Up Meetings

**Daily Stand-Up Meeting** (Huddle, Tier Meeting): Brief daily team meeting.

**Purpose:**
- Align the team (everyone knows priorities)
- Identify problems early
- Coordinate (who needs help, who can provide it)
- Engage employees (voice, visibility)

**Characteristics:**

**1. Short**
- 5-15 minutes (not a long meeting)
- Name "stand-up" suggests standing (keeps it brief)

**2. Daily**
- Same time every day (routine)
- Start of shift (set the day)

**3. Structured**
- Agenda consistent (not ad-hoc discussion)
- Focused (don't solve problems here—identify and assign)

**4. Visible**
- At visual management board (metrics, schedule)
- Everyone can see status

### Stand-Up Meeting Agenda

**1. Safety (2 minutes)**
- Incidents or near misses (yesterday)
- Safety focus for today (specific hazard or reminder)

**2. Metrics Review (3 minutes)**
- Yesterday's performance (parts produced, OEE, quality)
- Trend (green, yellow, red?)

**3. Schedule Review (3 minutes)**
- Jobs due today or this week
- Priorities (what's most important?)
- Challenges (any issues foreseen?)

**4. Problems and Actions (5 minutes)**
- Open issues from yesterday (status?)
- New problems identified (assign owner, due date)
- Quick wins (solved problems, celebrate)

**5. Other (2 minutes)**
- Announcements (visitors, schedule changes)
- Recognition (shout-outs for good work)

**Example Stand-Up:**

```
6:00 AM - Team gathers at Cell 3 board

Supervisor: "Good morning, team. Let's get started."

SAFETY:
Supervisor: "No incidents yesterday—great job.
Today's safety focus: We're moving heavy castings
for Job 2050. Remember to use the hoist, not manual
lifting. Questions?"

METRICS:
Supervisor: "Yesterday's OEE: 78%, up from 74% last
week. Nice improvement! First pass yield: 96%, on
target. On-time delivery: 94%, two jobs ran late.
Let's focus on staying on schedule today."

SCHEDULE:
Supervisor: "Priority today: Complete Job 2045—due
to ship by 3 PM. 20 parts remaining, should finish
by noon. Next priority: Job 2050 setup. Mike, you're
leading that setup, right?"

Mike: "Yes, I'll start at 1 PM after Job 2045.
Tooling is ready."

PROBLEMS:
Supervisor: "Open issues. Mill-1 coolant pump noise—
maintenance inspecting today. Jane, any update?"

Jane: "Maintenance scheduled for 10 AM. Should be
quick fix."

Supervisor: "Good. Any new issues?"

John: "Lathe-2 tool changer is slow—adds 10 seconds
per tool change. Not critical but annoying."

Supervisor: "Noted. I'll have maintenance check it
during PM tomorrow. Anything else?"

[No response]

Supervisor: "Alright, quick shout-out to Sarah—her
suggestion to reorganize tool crib saved us time
yesterday. Nice work! Let's have a great day.
Any questions?"

[Meeting ends: 6:12 AM, 12 minutes]
```

**Benefits:**
- Team aligned (everyone knows priorities)
- Problems identified early (not hidden)
- Fast (12 minutes vs. hour-long meetings)
- Engaged team (everyone participates)

## 23.14.4 Problem Escalation Procedures

**Escalation**: Raising problems to higher authority when needed.

**Why Needed:**

Not all problems can be solved at operator level:
- Authority limits (can't approve spending, process changes)
- Expertise limits (complex troubleshooting, engineering)
- Time limits (urgent problems needing immediate decision)

**Escalation ensures:**
- Problems addressed quickly
- Right people involved
- No critical issues stuck

### Escalation Levels

**Level 1: Operator**

**Authority:**
- Minor adjustments (speeds, feeds within limits)
- Standard troubleshooting (follow procedures)
- Request support (materials, tooling)

**Escalate if:**
- Problem beyond authority or expertise
- Safety issue
- Quality issue (parts outside tolerance)
- Machine malfunction

**Level 2: Supervisor / Cell Leader**

**Authority:**
- Adjust schedule (within shift)
- Approve minor process changes
- Coordinate resources (assign people, equipment)
- Contact maintenance, quality, engineering

**Escalate if:**
- Major schedule impact (can't meet commitments)
- Significant cost (scrap, overtime)
- Customer complaint or urgent request
- Policy or safety violation

**Level 3: Manager**

**Authority:**
- Major schedule changes (delay deliveries, overtime)
- Approve significant spending
- Policy decisions
- Customer negotiations (delivery, pricing)

**Escalate if:**
- Business impact (revenue, reputation)
- Strategic decision needed
- Legal or compliance issue

### Escalation Procedure

**1. Identify Problem**
- What's wrong? (specific, factual)
- Impact? (safety, quality, delivery, cost)
- Urgency? (immediate, today, this week)

**2. Attempt Resolution** (at your level)
- Standard troubleshooting
- Consult procedures, work instructions
- Ask peers (has anyone seen this before?)

**3. Escalate** (if can't resolve)
- **Who**: Notify supervisor (or appropriate person)
- **How**: Face-to-face, phone, or escalation system
- **What to communicate**:
  - Problem description (what, when, where)
  - Impact (why it matters)
  - Actions taken (what you've tried)
  - Recommendation (if you have one)

**4. Follow Through**
- Assist with resolution (provide info, test solutions)
- Document outcome (for future reference)
- Communicate resolution (to team, if relevant)

**Example Escalation:**

**Operator** (discovers parts out of tolerance):
1. Stops production (authority: stop if quality issue)
2. Notifies **Supervisor** immediately
3. Describes problem: "Last 5 parts are oversize on
   2.000" diameter—measuring 2.008" to 2.012".
   Tolerance is ±0.005"."
4. Supervisor investigates, calls **Quality Inspector**
   for verification
5. Inspector confirms: Parts nonconforming
6. Supervisor **escalates to Manager**: "Job 2045 has
   quality issue—10 parts scrapped, 20 parts at risk.
   Need engineering review of program and offsets.
   May impact delivery."
7. Manager approves: Engineering review, authorize
   overtime if needed to recover schedule
8. Problem resolved, documented, corrective action
   implemented

**Visual Escalation System:**

**Andon system** (colored lights):
- **Green**: Normal
- **Yellow**: Operator needs assistance (non-critical)
- **Red**: Critical issue (stop production, immediate help)

Supervisor sees lights across floor, responds appropriately.

## 23.14.5 Employee Suggestion Systems

**Suggestion System**: Formal process for employees to propose improvements.

**Why Important:**

- **Front-line knowledge**: Operators see problems and opportunities daily
- **Engagement**: Employees feel valued when ideas are heard
- **Improvement**: Small ideas add up to significant impact
- **Culture**: Encourages continuous improvement mindset

**Without suggestion system:**
- Good ideas lost (not captured)
- Employees feel unheard (apathy)
- Management unaware of issues

### Suggestion System Design

**1. Easy to Submit**

- **Suggestion form** (paper or digital)
- **Suggestion box** (accessible location)
- **Online system** (intranet, email, app)
- **Verbal** (to supervisor, recorded)

**Simple form:**
- Name (optional: anonymous if preferred)
- Date
- Description of idea (what, why, how)
- Expected benefit (time, cost, quality, safety)

**2. Prompt Review**

- **Review within 1-2 weeks** (not months)
- **Cross-functional team** (operations, engineering, quality)
- **Criteria**: Feasibility, cost, benefit, risk

**3. Decision and Feedback**

- **Approve**: Implement, assign owner, timeline
- **Decline**: Explain why (respectfully)
- **Hold**: Need more information or later timing

**Communicate decision to suggester** (always, even if declined)

**4. Implementation**

- Approved suggestions implemented promptly
- Suggester involved (if possible and willing)
- Results tracked (did it achieve expected benefit?)

**5. Recognition**

- **Acknowledge all suggestions** (thank you)
- **Celebrate implemented suggestions** (publicly)
- **Rewards** (if appropriate):
  - Monetary (% of savings, flat amount)
  - Non-monetary (recognition, certificate, lunch)

### Suggestion Metrics

**Track effectiveness:**
- Suggestions submitted per employee per year
- Acceptance rate (% approved)
- Implementation rate (% of approved actually implemented)
- Savings or benefits achieved

**Targets:**
- 1-5 suggestions per employee per year
- 50%+ acceptance rate
- 80%+ implementation rate (for approved)

**Example Suggestion Board:**

## 23.14.6 Team-Based Problem Solving

**Team-Based Problem Solving**: Cross-functional teams tackle complex problems.

**Why Teams?**

Complex problems require:
- Multiple perspectives (operators, engineers, quality)
- Diverse expertise (machining, programming, materials)
- Buy-in (people support what they help create)

**When to Use Teams:**

- **Complex problems**: Root cause not obvious
- **Cross-functional issues**: Affect multiple departments
- **High impact**: Significant cost, quality, or safety concern
- **Improvement projects**: Kaizen events, process optimization

### Problem-Solving Process

**1. Define the Problem**

- **What**: Specific, measurable problem statement
- **Where**: Location, machine, operation
- **When**: When does it occur? (pattern?)
- **Impact**: Cost, time, quality, safety

**Example:**
- **Problem**: Scrap rate on Part 12345-A is 8% (target: < 2%)
- **Where**: Mill-3, Op 20 (hole drilling)
- **When**: Started 2 weeks ago
- **Impact**: $4,000/month in scrap

**2. Form the Team**

**5-8 people** (not too large):
- **Leader**: Facilitates, keeps on track
- **Members**: Relevant expertise and perspective
  - Operator (runs the operation)
  - Setup person (setup expertise)
  - Programmer (if program-related)
  - Quality inspector (inspection data)
  - Supervisor (authority to implement)
  - Engineer (technical expertise, if needed)

**3. Analyze Root Cause**

**Tools:**
- **5 Whys**: Ask "why" repeatedly to find root cause
- **Fishbone Diagram** (Ishikawa): Categorize possible causes (machine, method, material, measurement, environment, people)
- **Data analysis**: Review scrap parts, inspection data, trends

**Example 5 Whys:**
1. **Why** is scrap rate 8%? → Holes are oversize
2. **Why** are holes oversize? → Drill is deflecting
3. **Why** is drill deflecting? → Drill is too long (L/D ratio too high)
4. **Why** is drill too long? → No shorter drill available in crib
5. **Why** no shorter drill? → Not ordered (didn't know needed)

**Root Cause**: Improper tool selection (didn't consider deflection)

**4. Develop Solutions**

**Brainstorm** possible solutions:
- Shorter drill (reduce deflection)
- Pilot hole first (reduce load)
- Slower speed (reduce heat/expansion)
- Peck drilling (chip evacuation)

**Evaluate** solutions:
- Feasibility (can we do this?)
- Cost (how much?)
- Time (how long to implement?)
- Effectiveness (will it solve problem?)

**Select** best solution (or combination)

**5. Implement**

- **Action plan**: Who, what, when
- **Pilot test**: Try on small batch first
- **Verify**: Did it work? (measure scrap rate)

**6. Standardize**

- **Update documents**: Work instructions, tool lists, program
- **Train**: Ensure everyone knows new method
- **Monitor**: Track scrap rate going forward (sustain improvement)

**7. Celebrate**

- Recognize team (meeting, board, email)
- Share learning (other areas benefit?)

### Problem-Solving Meeting Structure

**Kick-Off Meeting** (1 hour):
- Define problem
- Form team, assign roles
- Schedule follow-up meetings

**Working Meetings** (1-2 hours each, weekly):
- Review data, analyze root cause
- Brainstorm solutions
