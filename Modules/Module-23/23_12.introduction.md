# Module 23 – Shop Organization and Management


## Introduction

**Safety** is not negotiable—it must be the foundation of all manufacturing operations.

**The Reality:**
- Manufacturing has inherent hazards: rotating machinery, sharp edges, heavy materials, chemical exposure
- Accidents cause human suffering, lost productivity, legal liability, and financial cost
- Most accidents are preventable through proper organization, training, and culture

**Housekeeping** is safety:
- Clean, organized shops are safer
- Clutter causes trips, falls, and fires
- Good housekeeping prevents accidents and improves efficiency

**This section covers:**
- Safety as a foundation of organization
- Housekeeping standards
- Safety equipment organization
- Hazardous material management
- Ergonomics and workstation design
- Safety audits and inspections

## 23.12.1 Safety as a Foundation of Organization

**Safety First—Always**

Safety must be prioritized above production, schedule, and cost.

**Why Safety is Non-Negotiable:**

**1. Moral Imperative**
- Every worker deserves to go home safe
- No product is worth an injury or life

**2. Legal Requirement**
- OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) regulations
- Workers' compensation laws
- Liability for unsafe conditions

**3. Business Impact**
- Accidents cost money: Medical, workers' comp, legal, downtime
- OSHA fines can be substantial ($10,000-$100,000+ per violation)
- Reputation damage (customers, employees, community)

**4. Culture and Morale**
- Safe environment → employees feel valued
- Unsafe environment → high turnover, low morale
- "If they don't care about safety, what else don't they care about?"

### Safety Culture

**Safety Culture**: Shared values, beliefs, and practices around safety.

**Characteristics of Strong Safety Culture:**

1. **Leadership Commitment**
   - Leaders model safe behavior (wear PPE, follow rules)
   - Safety discussed in meetings
   - Resources allocated (equipment, training)

2. **Employee Engagement**
   - Everyone empowered to stop work if unsafe
   - Near-miss reporting encouraged (not punished)
   - Safety suggestions welcomed

3. **Zero Tolerance for Violations**
   - Rules enforced consistently (no exceptions)
   - Consequences for violations (coaching, discipline)

4. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Regular safety audits
   - Incident investigation (root cause, corrective action)
   - Training and refreshers

**Building Safety Culture:**

- **Start at top**: Leadership must walk the talk
- **Engage everyone**: Safety is everyone's responsibility, not just "safety officer"
- **Visible commitment**: Post safety metrics, celebrate milestones (days without injury)
- **Respond to incidents**: Investigate thoroughly, implement changes, communicate learnings

## 23.12.2 Housekeeping Standards

**Good Housekeeping = Safety + Efficiency**

### 23.12.2.1 Daily Cleaning Routines

**Daily Cleaning** (Last 10-15 minutes of shift):

**Each Operator's Responsibility:**

1. **Machine Area**
   - Wipe down machine exterior
   - Remove chips from machine and floor
   - Clean coolant trays and guards
   - Organize tools (return to shadow board or cart)

2. **Workstation**
   - Clear work surfaces
   - Return tools and gages
   - Empty trash and recycling

3. **Floor**
   - Sweep around machine (chips, debris)
   - No oil or coolant spills (clean immediately)
   - Aisles clear (no obstructions)

**Shared Areas** (rotate responsibility):
- Break room: Clean tables, counters; empty trash
- Restrooms: Stock supplies, light cleaning
- Common tool areas: Organize, clean

**Supervisor Check:**
- Walk floor at end of shift
- Verify cleaning completed
- Address any issues

### 23.12.2.2 Chip and Coolant Management

**Chips**: Metal chips and swarf from machining.

**Hazards:**
- **Sharp**: Can cut hands, eyes
- **Fire**: Fine chips (especially magnesium, aluminum) can ignite
- **Tripping**: Chips on floor create slip/trip hazard
- **Machine damage**: Chips in ways or slides cause wear

**Chip Management:**

**1. Chip Conveyors**
- Automated chip removal from machine
- Empty chip containers regularly (daily or as needed)
- Don't overfill (spills create mess)

**2. Chip Bins**
- Designated bins for chips (by material type for recycling)
- Empty before full (prevents spills)
- Recycle chips (revenue source)

**3. Floor Sweeping**
- Sweep chips immediately (don't let accumulate)
- Use broom or shop vacuum (not compressed air—chips become projectiles)

**Coolant Management:**

**Coolant (cutting fluid)** requires regular maintenance:

**Daily:**
- Check coolant level (top off if low)
- Skim tramp oil from surface (floating oil layer)
- Remove chips and debris from tank

**Weekly:**
- Test coolant concentration (refractometer)
  - Too weak: Poor lubrication, rust
  - Too strong: Waste, skin irritation
  - Target: Per manufacturer spec (often 5-10%)
- Check pH (should be 8.5-9.5 typically)
- Add biocide if needed (prevents bacteria growth, "Monday morning smell")

**Monthly:**
- Deep clean coolant tank (drain, scrub, refill)
- Inspect coolant pump and filters

**Safety:**
- Coolant spills on floor = slip hazard (clean immediately)
- Prolonged skin contact = irritation (wear gloves, wash hands)
- Bacteria in coolant = health risk (maintain properly)

### 23.12.2.3 Waste and Scrap Handling

**Waste Types in CNC Shops:**

1. **Metal Scrap**: Chips, cut-offs, rejected parts
2. **Coolant**: Used or contaminated coolant
3. **Oily Rags**: Rags with oil, coolant, solvents
4. **Trash**: General waste (packaging, paper, etc.)

**Segregation:**

**Separate by Type:**
- Metal scrap by type (aluminum, steel, stainless, brass)—recycling value
- Hazardous waste separate (oily rags, chemicals)—disposal regulations
- General trash

**Containers:**
- Clearly labeled (contents, disposal instructions)
- Appropriate size (not too large—heavy when full)
- Covered if needed (prevent spills, odors, fire)

**Location:**
- Convenient (near where waste generated)
- Out of aisles (don't block traffic)
- Proper ventilation (if fumes)

**Disposal:**

- **Metal scrap**: Recycle (contact scrap metal dealer)
  - Revenue source
  - Environmental benefit

- **Coolant**: Dispose per regulations (can't just dump down drain)
  - Licensed waste disposal company or recycling service
  - Some coolant can be filtered/reconditioned and reused

- **Hazardous waste** (oily rags, solvents, chemicals):
  - RCRA regulations (Resource Conservation and Recovery Act)
  - Must use licensed hazardous waste hauler
  - Proper labeling and manifests required
  - Fire hazard: Oily rags spontaneous combustion risk (use metal can with lid)

- **General trash**: Regular waste disposal

**Frequency:**
- Empty bins before full (prevent overflow)
- Schedule pickups (scrap dealer, waste hauler)

- Repetitive motions → tendonitis, carpal tunnel
- Awkward postures → muscle strain
- Prolonged standing → fatigue, leg/back pain

### Ergonomic Principles

**1. Neutral Postures**
- Avoid bending, twisting, reaching overhead
- Work at waist height (24-48 inches)
- Elbows at 90° when working

**2. Minimize Force**
- Use mechanical assists (hoists, carts)
- Leverage tools (not brute force)

**3. Reduce Repetition**
- Vary tasks (not same motion thousands of times)
- Job rotation
- Automation where practical

**4. Adjust to Individual**
- Adjustable work surfaces, chairs, equipment
- Not everyone same height

**5. Provide Rest**
- Breaks (micro-breaks and meal breaks)
- Anti-fatigue mats (standing work)
- Seating available (when possible)

### Workstation Design

**Machine Operator Station:**

**1. Machine Height**
- Controls at comfortable height (not overhead or floor-level)
- Modern machines generally well-designed, but verify

**2. Material Staging**
- Raw material and finished goods within easy reach (< 18 inches)
- Use carts, tables at proper height (avoid bending to floor)

**3. Anti-Fatigue Mats**
- Cushioned mat at operator position
- Reduces fatigue from standing on concrete

**4. Seating**
- Stool or sit-stand chair (if operator can sit during auto cycle)

**Inspection Station:**

**1. Surface Height**
- 36-42 inches (standing) or 28-30 inches (seated)
- Adjustable ideal

**2. Lighting**
- Task lighting (supplement overhead)
- Minimize glare, shadows

**3. Part Positioning**
- Parts at comfortable height (not bending or reaching)
- Fixtures or vises hold parts (hands-free)

**Assembly or Deburr Station:**

**1. Work Surface**

2. **High Priority**: Correct within 24-48 hours (serious hazard)
3. **Medium Priority**: Correct within 1-2 weeks (moderate hazard)
4. **Low Priority**: Correct within 30 days (minor hazard or improvement)

**Track to Completion:**
- Assign responsibility
- Set deadline
- Follow up (verify completed)
- Document (before/after photos, date completed)

### Safety Metrics

**Track Performance:**

**1. Injury Rate**

**OSHA Recordable Incident Rate:**

```
                  (Number of Recordable Injuries × 200,000)
Incident Rate = ───────────────────────────────────────────
                    Total Hours Worked by All Employees
```

200,000 = 100 employees × 2,000 hours/year (standard base)

**Example:**
- 2 recordable injuries
- 25 employees × 2,000 hours = 50,000 hours
- Incident Rate = (2 × 200,000) / 50,000 = 8.0

**Benchmark**: Industry average (metalworking ~3-5)

**2. Lost Time Injury Rate**

Injuries resulting in time off work (more serious).

**3. Near Misses**

Events that could have caused injury but didn't (luck).
- Track and investigate (same as actual injuries—learning opportunity)
- High near-miss reporting = good safety culture (not hiding)

**4. Safety Audit Scores**

- % compliance on audits
- Track trend (improving?)

**5. Days Without Accident**

- Visible metric (posted on board)
- Celebrate milestones (30, 100, 365 days)

**Goal**: Trend toward zero injuries (continuous improvement)
