## 21.12.5 Troubleshooting Measurement Discrepancies

Measurement discrepancies between different methods or operators are common challenges requiring systematic investigation.

### Case Study: CMM vs. Micrometer Disagreement

**Problem Statement**:
Machinist measures shaft diameter as 1.2505" with micrometer (within tolerance of 1.250 ±0.002").
QC inspector measures same shaft on CMM as 1.2525" (out of upper tolerance).
Part rejected. Machinist disputes. Who is correct?

**Investigation Process**:

**Step 1: Verify Calibration**
- Check micrometer calibration certificate: Due date valid, last calibration passed
- Check CMM calibration: Annual calibration current, probe qualification valid
- Conclusion: Both instruments calibrated

**Step 2: Examine Measurement Technique**

**Micrometer**:
- Observed operator technique: Measuring at one location, moderate force
- Issue identified: Measuring at only one axial location

**CMM**:
- Reviewed CMM program: Circle fit from 8 points at one Z height
- Issue identified: Only one cross-section measured

**Step 3: Comprehensive Measurement**

**CMM - Multiple Cross-Sections**:
- Measured circles at 5 axial locations along shaft
- Results:
  - Z = 0mm: Ø1.2523"
  - Z = 10mm: Ø1.2518"
  - Z = 20mm: Ø1.2515" (center)
  - Z = 30mm: Ø1.2508"
  - Z = 40mm: Ø1.2505"

**Conclusion**: Shaft has taper of 0.0018" over length (hourglass shape)

**Step 4: Root Cause Analysis**

**Machining Process Review**:
- Part held in 3-jaw chuck
- Long slender shaft (L/D = 10)
- Single pass turning operation

**Root Cause**: Workpiece deflection during cutting
- Cutting forces pushed part away from tool at center
- Result: Smaller diameter at ends, larger at center
- Taper: 0.0018" over length

**Step 5: Corrective Action**

**Immediate**:
- Parts measured at location of maximum diameter
- Out-of-tolerance parts identified and scrapped or reworked

**Permanent Fix**:
- Added center support (steady rest) during turning
- Reduced cutting forces (lighter DOC, optimized speed/feed)
- Changed cutting sequence (rough from both ends, finish pass)

**Process Validation**:
- CMM measurement of revised process
- Cylindricity improved from 0.0018" to 0.0004"
- All cross-sections within tolerance
- Cpk improved from 0.6 to 1.8

**Lessons Learned**:

1. **Multiple measurement locations**: Single-point measurements can miss form errors
2. **Understand GD&T**: Drawing didn't specify cylindricity tolerance (assumed straightness)
3. **Communication**: Machinist and inspector measuring different things (different locations)
4. **Root cause**: Both instruments were correct; part had form error
5. **Process improvement**: Metrology data revealed machining problem

**Updated Inspection Procedure**:
- CMM measures cylindricity (multiple cross-sections)
- Inspection drawing clarified with cylindricity tolerance
- Operator training on proper measurement technique
- Added cylindricity monitoring to SPC
