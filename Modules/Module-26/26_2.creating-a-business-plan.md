| XYZ Machining | $500K-1M | 3-5 | 5 machines, modern | None | Fast, technology | No certs, quality issues | Commercial |
| Smith Shop | $200K-300K | 1-2 | 3 machines, basic | None | Low price, flexible | Limited capacity | Price-sensitive |

### 2.2.4 Pricing Research

**Market Rate Research:**

**Method 1: Quote Requests**
- Prepare sample parts (representative of your target work)
- Request quotes from 5-10 competitors
- Analyze pricing structure and ranges
- Note: Be ethical—use representative parts you might actually produce

**Method 2: Industry Benchmarks**

Typical machine hour rates by region and type:

**Regional Variations (2024 Estimates):**
- West Coast (CA, WA, OR): $95-135/hr
- Northeast (NY, MA, CT): $85-125/hr
- Midwest (OH, MI, WI): $75-105/hr
- Southeast (GA, NC, SC, FL): $70-100/hr
- South/Central (TX, OK, KS): $65-95/hr

**By Shop Type:**
- Basic job shop (3-axis, no certs): $65-85/hr
- Certified job shop (AS9100/ISO): $85-105/hr
- Advanced capabilities (5-axis, multi-axis): $105-145/hr
- Prototype/rush service: $125-175/hr
- Production/volume work: $60-85/hr (higher volume, lower rate)

**Method 3: Customer Surveys**

Ask potential customers:
- What are you currently paying per hour?
- What's a fair price range for typical parts?
- How much would you pay for faster turnaround?
- What would you pay for certified vs. non-certified?

**Pricing Strategy Development:**

**Cost-Plus Approach:**
1. Calculate true cost per hour (see Section 4.3)
2. Add desired profit margin
3. Compare to market rates
4. Adjust based on positioning

**Value-Based Approach:**
1. Identify customer value drivers (speed, quality, service)
2. Price based on value delivered, not just cost
3. Premium pricing for premium value
4. Example: Charge 20% more for 50% faster delivery

**Competitive Positioning:**
- **Low-Price Provider:** Cost + 15-25% markup (requires efficiency)
- **Market Rate:** Cost + 30-40% markup (standard positioning)
- **Premium:** Cost + 40-60% markup (requires clear differentiation)

**Recommendation for New Shops:**
Target **market rate to slightly premium** (Cost + 35-45%). Don't compete on price alone—you can't win against established efficient shops. Compete on service, quality, responsiveness.

## 2.3 Unique Value Proposition

Your **Unique Value Proposition (UVP)** is the clear statement of:
1. What you offer
2. Who you serve
3. What makes you different/better
4. Why customers should choose you

**UVP Formula:**

```
We help [target customer]
achieve [benefit/outcome]
through [unique approach/capability]
unlike [alternative/competition]
because [proof/credentials]
```

**Examples:**

**Example 1: Certified Niche Shop**
```
We help aerospace and medical manufacturers achieve faster time-to-market
for complex precision components through AS9100 and ISO 13485-certified
processes, 2-week standard lead times, and direct engineering support
from our owner with 15 years of industry experience.
```

**Example 2: Prototype Specialist**
```
We help product development teams iterate faster by delivering complex
prototypes in 3-5 days instead of the industry standard 2-3 weeks,
with engineering feedback and design-for-manufacturability recommendations
included in every quote.
```

**Example 3: Exotic Materials Specialist**
```
We help industrial OEMs solve their most challenging material requirements
through specialized expertise in titanium, inconel, and high-performance
alloys backed by 20+ years of experience and dedicated equipment for
difficult-to-machine materials.
```

**Creating Your UVP:**

**Step 1: Identify Customer Pain Points**
- What problems do your target customers face?
- What frustrates them about current suppliers?
- What needs are unmet in the market?

**Step 2: Define Your Differentiation**
- What do you do better/differently?
- What unique capabilities or credentials do you have?
- Why would a customer choose you over alternatives?

**Step 3: Focus on Benefits, Not Features**

| Feature (What) | Benefit (Why It Matters) |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| AS9100 certification | Faster approval, less paperwork, lower risk |
| 2-week lead time | Reduce inventory, respond to customers faster |
| Owner-operated | Direct communication, expert attention, accountability |
| Modern CAM software | Lower programming costs passed to customers |
| 4-axis machining | Reduce setups, tighter tolerances, complex geometries |

**Step 4: Test and Refine**
- Share with potential customers—does it resonate?
- Clear and understandable in 10 seconds?
- Differentiating or generic (could any shop say this)?
- Credible and provable?

**Common Mistakes:**

❌ **Generic/Weak UVPs:**
- "Quality machining services" (everyone claims quality)
- "Competitive prices and fast turnaround" (meaningless without specifics)
- "Customer service is our priority" (empty statement)

✓ **Strong UVPs:**
- Specific about who you serve
- Quantifiable benefits (2-week lead time, not "fast")
- Clear differentiation (AS9100 certified, not "quality-focused")
- Credible proof points (15 years experience, not "experienced team")

3. **Selectively pursue national** based on niche positioning (Years 5+)
4. **Avoid international** unless unique circumstances

## 2.5 Exit Strategy and Succession Planning

**Why Plan Your Exit Early:**

Even if you intend to run the business for decades, planning your exit from day one is critical:

1. **Builds Business Value:** Decisions that increase sellability also improve operations
2. **Provides Options:** Health issues, opportunities, market changes may force unexpected exit
3. **Reduces Risk:** Plan B if business doesn't work out
4. **Motivates Strategy:** Clear end goal focuses decision-making

**Exit Options:**

### Option 1: Sale to Strategic Buyer

**Buyer:** Larger shop seeking capacity, capabilities, customers, or geographic expansion

**Timeline:** Typically 5-15 years of operation
**Valuation:** 3-6x EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization)

**Example:**
- Business EBITDA: $200,000/year
- Valuation: 4x EBITDA = $800,000 sale price

**Maximizing Sale Value:**
- Documented processes and systems (not dependent on owner)
- Diverse customer base (not concentrated risk)
- Certifications and specialized capabilities
- Modern equipment in good condition
- Clean financial records
- Trained employees
- Recurring revenue and contracts

**Sale Process:**
- Engage business broker (8-12% commission)
- Prepare business for sale (6-12 months)
- Marketing and negotiation (3-6 months)
- Due diligence and closing (2-4 months)
- **Total timeline: 12-24 months**

### Option 2: Sale to Financial Buyer (Private Equity)

**Buyer:** Investment firm seeking cash flow and ROI

**Timeline:** Typically requires established, profitable business ($2M+ revenue, $300K+ EBITDA)
**Valuation:** 4-7x EBITDA

**Less common for small CNC shops; more relevant for larger operations**

### Option 3: Sale to Employees (ESOP - Employee Stock Ownership Plan)

**Advantages:**
- Reward loyal employees
- Tax advantages
- Gradual transition
- Preserve company culture

**Disadvantages:**
- Complex legal structure
- Requires profitable business and adequate employees
- Lower valuation than outside sale (employees have limited capital)

**Realistic for shops with 10+ employees and $1M+ revenue**

### Option 4: Family Succession

**Transfer business to son, daughter, or other family member**

**Advantages:**
- Keep business in family
- Gradual transition and mentoring
- Preserve legacy and culture
- Potential tax advantages

**Challenges:**
- Is family member capable and interested?
- Other family members' expectations
- Valuation and fairness
- Letting go of control

**Critical Success Factors:**
