# Module 6 – Spindle & Rotary Tools


## Introduction

Spindle systems present multiple safety hazards: rotating components at speeds exceeding 24,000 rpm generate kinetic energies capable of ejecting tools at velocities over 100 m/s, electrical systems operate at voltages up to 480V AC with fault currents exceeding 1000A, and mechanical failures can produce flying debris with injury potential. Comprehensive safety systems integrate hardware interlocks (sensors, relays, contactors) with software logic (PLC ladder, CNC parameters) to prevent hazardous conditions and protect operators, equipment, and workpieces.

Modern CNC safety architectures follow IEC 61508 (functional safety) and ISO 13849-1 (machine safety), defining Safety Integrity Levels (SIL) and Performance Levels (PL) based on risk assessment. Spindle safety systems typically require PL d or PLr d (high reliability with single fault tolerance), achieved through redundant sensing, monitored circuits, and fail-safe default states.

## Safety Interlock Architecture

### Emergency Stop (E-Stop) System

Emergency stop systems provide immediate power removal with Category 0 (uncontrolled stop) or Category 1 (controlled stop then power removal) characteristics:

**Category 0 E-Stop:** Direct contactor opening removes spindle drive power within 1-2 electrical cycles (16-33 ms at 60 Hz), but kinetic energy causes extended coast-down:

$$\theta_{coast} = \frac{\omega_0^2}{2 \alpha}$$

where $\theta_{coast}$ is coast-down angle (rad), $\omega_0$ is initial angular velocity (rad/s), and $\alpha$ is deceleration rate (rad/s²) from friction and windage.

**Worked Example 6.10.1 - E-Stop Coast-Down Time:**

A 3 kW spindle operating at 18,000 rpm with rotor inertia $J = 0.002$ kg·m² experiences friction torque $T_{friction} = 0.5$ N·m. Calculate coast-down time after Category 0 E-Stop:

Initial angular velocity:
$$\omega_0 = \frac{2\pi \times 18000}{60} = 1885 \text{ rad/s}$$

Deceleration from friction:
$$\alpha = \frac{T_{friction}}{J} = \frac{0.5}{0.002} = 250 \text{ rad/s}^2$$

Coast-down time:
$$t_{stop} = \frac{\omega_0}{\alpha} = \frac{1885}{250} = 7.5 \text{ seconds}$$

**Analysis:** 7.5 second coast-down presents hazard if operator assumes immediate stop. Category 1 stop with dynamic braking reduces this to <2 seconds by injecting DC current creating electromagnetic braking torque of 5-10 N·m.

**Category 1 E-Stop with Dynamic Braking:**

Dynamic braking injects DC current into motor windings, creating stationary magnetic field that opposes rotor rotation:

$$T_{brake} = k_b \cdot I_{DC}$$

where $T_{brake}$ is braking torque (N·m), $k_b$ is motor brake constant (0.8-1.2 N·m/A for typical spindle motors), and $I_{DC}$ is DC injection current (A, typically 50-100% of rated current).

For the example above with $I_{DC} = 4$ A and $k_b = 1.0$ N·m/A:

$$T_{brake} = 1.0 \times 4 = 4.0 \text{ N·m}$$

Total deceleration torque: $T_{total} = T_{brake} + T_{friction} = 4.0 + 0.5 = 4.5$ N·m

Revised coast-down time:
$$t_{stop} = \frac{\omega_0 J}{T_{total}} = \frac{1885 \times 0.002}{4.5} = 0.84 \text{ seconds}$$

9× faster stopping reduces hazard exposure significantly.

### Speed Monitoring and Overspeed Protection

Spindle overspeed (exceeding rated maximum by 10-20%) causes catastrophic bearing failure or tool ejection. Overspeed protection compares encoder feedback to commanded speed:

$$\Delta n = n_{measured} - n_{commanded}$$

Overspeed fault triggers when:
$$\Delta n > n_{threshold} = 0.05 \times n_{max}$$

Typical threshold: 5% of maximum speed. For 24,000 rpm spindle, fault at 25,200 rpm (1,200 rpm margin).

**Response time requirements:** IEC 61800-5-2 specifies safe torque-off (STO) activation within 10 ms of overspeed detection. This prevents bearing temperature rise:

$$\Delta T_{bearing} = \frac{P_{friction} \cdot t_{response}}{m_{bearing} \cdot c_p}$$

where $P_{friction}$ is bearing friction power at overspeed (W), $t_{response}$ is detection-to-STO delay (s), $m_{bearing}$ is bearing mass (kg), and $c_p$ is specific heat (460 J/kg·K for steel).

### Tool Holding Verification

Automatic tool changers (ATC) require verification that tool is properly seated before spindle start:

**Draw bar force monitoring:** Hydraulic or pneumatic draw bar clamps tool with force 1500-3000 N. Pressure sensor confirms clamping pressure within tolerance:

$$F_{clamp} = P_{hydraulic} \cdot A_{piston} \cdot \eta_{mechanical}$$

where $P_{hydraulic}$ is hydraulic pressure (bar), $A_{piston}$ is piston area (cm²), and $\eta_{mechanical}$ is mechanical efficiency (0.85-0.95).

Acceptance criteria:
- Minimum clamp force: 1500 N (prevents tool pullout during heavy cutting)
- Maximum clamp force: 3500 N (prevents tool holder damage)
- Pressure stability: <5% variation over 10 seconds (detects seal leaks)

**Tool presence sensing:** Proximity sensor or mechanical switch confirms tool in spindle. Interlock prevents spindle rotation if:
1. Tool absent (proximity sensor open circuit)
2. Tool improperly seated (draw bar position sensor out of range)
3. Tool too long (collision detection limit switch)

### Spindle Orientation Lock

Spindle orientation holds specific angular position for tool changes, thread cutting, or rigid tapping. Orientation interlock prevents motion commands while locked:

**Position holding torque:**
$$T_{hold} = k_t \cdot I_{hold}$$

where $k_t$ is motor torque constant (0.5-1.5 N·m/A) and $I_{hold}$ is holding current (1-3 A, 5-10% of rated current).

Position tolerance: ±0.5° (±3 arcmin) verified by encoder within 100 ms of orientation command.

**Interlock logic:**
- Orientation active → Disable speed commands, enable holding current
- Position error >1° → Fault alarm, require manual reset
- Unlock command → Verify no motion commands pending, release holding current

### Thermal Overload Protection

Spindle motor and bearing temperatures trigger staged protection:

**Temperature monitoring zones:**
1. **Motor winding:** RTD or thermocouple embedded in stator, limit 130-155°C (Class F/H insulation)
2. **Front bearing:** RTD near bearing outer race, limit 75-85°C
3. **Rear bearing:** RTD near bearing outer race, limit 75-85°C
4. **Coolant temperature:** Thermocouple in supply/return, monitor ΔT

**Protection stages:**

| Temperature | Action | Response Time |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| 70°C (bearing) | Warning alarm, log event | Continuous monitoring |
| 80°C (bearing) | Reduce speed to 75% maximum | <5 seconds |
| 85°C (bearing) | Controlled stop (Category 1) | <10 seconds |
| 90°C (bearing) | Emergency stop (Category 0) | <100 ms |
| 140°C (motor) | Emergency stop + cooling system fault | <100 ms |

**Thermal model for predictive protection:**

$$T(t) = T_{\infty} + (T_{operating} - T_{\infty})(1 - e^{-t/\tau})$$

where $T_{\infty}$ is ambient temperature, $T_{operating}$ is steady-state operating temperature, $\tau$ is thermal time constant (15-30 minutes for spindles), and $t$ is operating time.

PLC monitors temperature rise rate:
$$\frac{dT}{dt} = \frac{T_{operating} - T_{\infty}}{\tau} e^{-t/\tau}$$

Excessive rise rate (>2°C/min when $t < 2\tau$) indicates cooling system failure, triggering early shutdown before hard limit reached.

## Safety-Rated Inputs and Outputs

### Safe Torque Off (STO)

STO removes motor drive enable signals through redundant contactors or solid-state switches, achieving SIL 3 / PL e safety level:

**Dual-channel architecture:**
- Channel A: Safety relay monitors E-stop circuit, controls Contactor 1
- Channel B: Independent safety relay monitors E-stop circuit, controls Contactor 2
- Both contactors in series with VFD enable input
- Discrepancy detection: If one channel fails to open within 20 ms, system declares fault

**Verification test:**
$$P_{dangerous\_failure} = \lambda_{DC} \cdot t_{proof\_test}$$

where $\lambda_{DC}$ is dangerous failure rate per hour (typically 10⁻⁸ to 10⁻⁷ for safety relays) and $t_{proof\_test}$ is interval between verification tests (hours).

For PL d requirement: $P_{dangerous\_failure} < 10^{-6}$ per hour, requiring proof test every 240 hours (monthly for 8hr/day operation).

### Door Interlock System

Machine enclosure door interlocks prevent access during spindle operation:

**Safety door switch requirements (ISO 14119):**
- Type 4 coded magnetic switch (1000+ unique codes prevents bypassing with magnet)
- Monitored circuit: Dual-channel monitoring detects switch failure
- Mechanical guard locking: Solenoid lock prevents door opening while spindle running
- Lock release delay: 2-5 seconds after spindle stop command to allow coast-down

**Interlock logic:**
```
IF (Door_Open = TRUE) THEN
    Disable_Spindle_Start = TRUE
    IF (Spindle_Running = TRUE) THEN
        Execute_Category_1_Stop = TRUE
    END IF
END IF
```

### Coolant Flow Interlock

Liquid-cooled spindles require minimum coolant flow for thermal management:

**Flow verification:**
$$Q_{min} = \frac{P_{heat}}{c_p \cdot \rho \cdot \Delta T_{max}}$$

where $Q_{min}$ is minimum flow rate (L/min), $P_{heat}$ is heat generation (W), $c_p$ is coolant specific heat (4186 J/kg·K for water), $\rho$ is density (1000 kg/m³), and $\Delta T_{max}$ is maximum temperature rise (10-15°C).

**Worked Example 6.10.2 - Coolant Flow Requirement:**

A 5 kW spindle with 90% efficiency generates waste heat:
$$P_{heat} = P_{input} \cdot (1 - \eta) = 5000 \times (1 - 0.90) = 500 \text{ W}$$

Minimum flow for ΔT = 12°C:
$$Q_{min} = \frac{500}{4186 \times 1.0 \times 12} = 0.00996 \text{ kg/s} = 0.596 \text{ L/min}$$

Design flow: 2-3× minimum = 1.5-2.0 L/min for safety margin.

**Flow switch interlock:**
- Paddle-type or magnetic flow switch monitors coolant flow
- Minimum flow threshold: 1.0 L/min (safety margin above 0.6 L/min calculated)
- Delay timer: 30 seconds after spindle start to allow pump prime
- Fault response: Controlled stop if flow lost, prevent restart until flow restored
