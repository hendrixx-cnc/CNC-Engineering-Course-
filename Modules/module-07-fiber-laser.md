# Module 7 – Fiber Laser Systems

## 1. Introduction

Fiber lasers are used for high-precision cutting, engraving, and marking of metals and some plastics. They offer high efficiency, long life, and excellent beam quality.

## 2. Laser Source

- **Fiber laser**: Uses doped optical fiber as gain medium.
- Typical powers: 20–3000 W for CNC cutting.
- Wavelength: ~1064 nm (infrared).

## 3. Beam Delivery

- Fiber-coupled to cutting head via armored cable.
- Collimator and focusing lens shape the beam.
- Protective glass shields optics from spatter.

## 4. Cutting Head

- Auto-focus system maintains precise standoff distance.
- Nozzle design controls assist gas flow.
- Capacitive height sensor for Z axis control.

## 5. Assist Gas

- **Oxygen**: For mild steel; boosts speed and oxidation.
- **Nitrogen**: For stainless and aluminum; prevents oxidation, cleaner edge.
- **Air**: For thin materials and engraving.

## 6. Table and Enclosure

- Enclosed table for safety and fume extraction.
- Sliding doors and interlocks to block stray laser light.

## 7. CNC Integration

- Fiber laser connects to CNC controller via digital relay and analog power control.
- Program cut speed, power ramp, and pierce sequence.
- Use M-codes for laser on/off and gas control.

## 8. Safety

- Class 4 laser: requires interlocked enclosure.
- Wear certified laser safety glasses.
- Fume extraction for vaporized metals.

## 9. Maintenance

- Clean optics and replace protective glass regularly.
- Check fiber cable for bends or damage.
- Calibrate autofocus and inspect sensors.

## 10. Troubleshooting

- Incomplete cuts: check power, focus, and assist gas.
- Burrs or rough edge: adjust speed, power, and gas.
- No beam: inspect fiber connections and safety interlocks.

## 11. Conclusion

Fiber lasers deliver unmatched speed and quality for metal cutting and marking. Prioritize safety, maintain optics, and optimize gas and power settings for best results.
