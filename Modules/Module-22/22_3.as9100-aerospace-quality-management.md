**Work Transfer Scenarios**:
- Opening new manufacturing site
- Closing facility and moving to another
- Insourcing (bringing work in-house)
- Outsourcing (moving work to supplier)
- Customer transferring work to your facility

**Work Transfer Plan**:
- Identify risks to continuity
- Transfer of technical data (drawings, specifications, programs)
- Qualification of new processes/equipment
- Personnel training and competence
- Tooling and gage transfer/procurement
- First Article Inspection at new location
- Phase-in plan (parallel production, qualification lot)
- Verification of product conformity

**Example**:

- Approval workflow (engineering, quality, customer)
- Effectivity (serial number, date, lot)
- Document updates (drawings, specs, BOMs, work instructions)
- Notification to affected parties

**Example**:
ECN-1234: Change shaft material from 4140 to 4340 steel
- Reason: Improved strength for new application
- Impact: Affects material specification, heat treatment procedure, hardness range
- Effectivity: Serial numbers 5001 and up
- Approval: Engineering and customer approved
- Actions: Update drawing Rev C to D, revise heat treat work instruction, notify heat treat supplier, update control plan

#### Advanced Product Quality Planning (APQP)

While primarily an automotive tool (IATF 16949), many aerospace customers require APQP-like processes.

**APQP Phases** (summarized):
1. Plan and Define: Understand customer requirements
2. Product Design and Development: Design to meet requirements
3. Process Design and Development: Plan manufacturing processes
4. Product and Process Validation: Prove capable of production
5. Production and Continuous Improvement: Launch and improve

**Key Deliverables**:

- Change in material or supplier
- Change in manufacturing facility
- Natural or man-made event affecting manufacturing (flood, fire, reorganization)
- Lapse in production (typically >2 years for AS9100)
- Customer or regulatory requirement

#### AS9102 Standard

**AS9102** defines requirements for First Article Inspection in aerospace.

**Current Version**: AS9102B (Rev B)

**AS9102 Forms**:
- **Form 1**: Part Number Accountability (one per part number)
- **Form 2**: Product Accountability (one per characteristic)
- **Form 3**: Process/Material Verification (as needed)

#### Form 1: Part Number Accountability

**Purpose**: Identify the part and FAI context

**Information on Form 1**:

- Drawing number and revision
- Organization performing FAI
- Manufacturing process (machining, welding, assembly)
- Reason for FAI (new part, design change, process change, etc.)
- Quantity inspected
- Approval signatures (inspector, quality, customer if required)

#### Form 2: Product Accountability

**Purpose**: Document inspection results for each characteristic

**Information on Form 2**:
- Characteristic number (from drawing)
- Characteristic description (e.g., "Diameter of bore, .500±.002")
- Drawing requirement (dimension, tolerance, specification)
- Inspection method (micrometer, CMM, gage)

  - **Customer or drawing requirement** may specify larger sample

**Statistical Sampling**:
- Not typically used for FAI (FAI is detailed verification, not statistical sampling)
- Full dimensional inspection performed on sample

#### Partial FAI

**Partial FAI**: When only portion of part is affected by change, only changed characteristics require re-inspection.

**Example**:
Drawing revision changes one hole diameter but leaves other features unchanged:
- Perform FAI only on the changed hole diameter
- Reference previous FAI for unchanged characteristics
- Note "Partial FAI" on Form 1

#### FAI Documentation and Retention

**FAI Package Includes**:

**Customer Approval**:
- Some customers require FAI submission and approval before production release
- Others accept supplier self-approval (but must provide FAI upon request)
- Check contract or purchase order requirements

#### Delta FAI

**Delta FAI**: Simplified FAI when minor change occurs

**Criteria for Delta FAI**:
- Change is minor and well-understood
- Risk assessment shows low impact
- Customer agrees to Delta FAI approach

**Delta FAI Process**:
- Inspect only characteristics affected by change
- Document as Partial FAI or reference previous FAI

## 22.3.2 ISO 13485 (Medical Devices)

**ISO 13485** is the quality management standard for organizations involved in the design, production, installation, and servicing of medical devices.

### Overview

**ISO 13485:2016** (current version) specifies requirements for QMS where an organization needs to demonstrate ability to provide medical devices and related services that consistently meet customer and regulatory requirements.

**Scope**: Applies to:
- Medical device manufacturers
- Contract manufacturers of medical devices
- Component/material suppliers to medical device manufacturers
- Sterilization, installation, and servicing organizations

**Regulatory Connection**:
- Basis for regulatory submissions (FDA 510(k), PMA, EU MDR)
- Recognized by regulatory agencies worldwide
- Required for CE marking in Europe (EU Medical Device Regulation)

### Differences from ISO 9001

While ISO 13485 is based on ISO 9001, there are important differences:

| Aspect | ISO 9001 | ISO 13485 |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Focus | Customer satisfaction, continual improvement | Regulatory compliance, risk management |
| Continual Improvement | Emphasized throughout | Required only where mandated by regulation |
| Risk | Risk-based thinking | Risk management per ISO 14971 required |
| Documentation | Flexible, organization determines | Prescriptive, detailed documentation required |
| Design Controls | Optional (can be excluded) | Mandatory if organization designs devices |
| Validation | Special processes | Broader validation requirements |
| Regulatory | General | Specific regulatory requirements integrated |

**Key Takeaway**: ISO 13485 prioritizes **compliance and consistency** over improvement. Once validated, processes should remain unchanged unless improvement is required by regulation or risk management.

- Facilitates targeted recalls (recall specific lot, not all devices)

**Serial Number**:
- Unique to individual device
- Required for implantable and life-supporting devices
- Enables traceability to specific patient (important for implants)

**Traceability Matrix**:

| Device S/N | Lot Number | Mfg Date | Material Lot | Process Certs | Customer | Patient (if implant) |
|------------|------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------|----------------------|
| SN12345 | LOT-2024-05 | 2024-05-15 | MAT-55443 | HT-2024-120 | Hospital ABC | John Doe (if implant) |
| SN12346 | LOT-2024-05 | 2024-05-15 | MAT-55443 | HT-2024-120 | Hospital ABC | |

#### Device History Record (DHR)

**DHR**: Compilation of records for each manufactured device (or lot), documenting that device was manufactured per Device Master Record (DMR)

**DHR Contents**:
- Quantity manufactured
- Quantity released for distribution
- Acceptance records (inspection results, tests)

- Quantity
- Customer name and address
- Date of shipment
- Purchase order or invoice number

**Retention**: Typically life of device + several years (FDA: 2 years beyond device life expectancy)

#### Recall Process

**Recall Triggers**:
- Safety issue identified (potential harm to patients)
- Nonconformance affecting device performance
- Regulatory requirement (FDA mandates recall)

**Recall Process**:
1. **Identify Affected Devices**: Use traceability records to determine lot/serial numbers affected
2. **Notify**: Inform customers (hospitals, distributors), regulatory agencies (FDA, EU Notified Body)
3. **Communicate**: Provide instructions (return, destroy, modify)
4. **Track Effectiveness**: Verify devices retrieved or action taken
5. **Investigate and Correct**: Root cause analysis, corrective action to prevent recurrence
6. **Report**: Submit recall status reports to regulatory agencies

**Example Recall Scenario**:
- Issue: Heat treatment found out of specification for Lot 2024-05 (affects hardness, may fail in use)
- Affected Devices: All devices in Lot 2024-05 (serial numbers SN12340-SN12360)
- Action: Recall and replace
- Traceability: Distribution records show devices shipped to three hospitals
- Notification: Contact hospitals, request return of unused devices, track devices already implanted (may need monitoring or replacement)

### 22.3.3.3 Measurement Systems Analysis (MSA)

**MSA** evaluates measurement systems (gages, instruments, procedures) to ensure they provide accurate and repeatable data.

#### Why MSA Matters

**Measurement System Variation**:
- Total observed variation = Part variation + Measurement variation
- If measurement variation is large, difficult to assess part variation
- Inadequate measurement systems lead to bad decisions (accepting bad parts, rejecting good parts)

**MSA Objectives**:
- Quantify measurement system variation
- Determine if measurement system acceptable for application
- Identify sources of variation (gage, operator, part-to-part)
- Improve measurement system if necessary

#### Types of MSA Studies

**Gage R&R** (Repeatability and Reproducibility):
- **Repeatability**: Variation when same operator measures same part multiple times (equipment variation)
- **Reproducibility**: Variation between different operators measuring same part (appraiser variation)

**Bias**:
- Difference between observed average measurement and true value (accuracy)

**Linearity**:
- Bias consistent across measurement range (bias same for small and large values?)

**Stability**:
- Measurement system variation over time (does gage drift?)

#### Gage R&R Study

**Gage R&R** is most common MSA study, evaluating repeatability and reproducibility.

**Study Design**:
- **Parts**: 10 parts representing process variation (low, medium, high dimensions)
- **Operators**: 3 operators (appraisers)
- **Trials**: Each operator measures each part 3 times
- **Total measurements**: 10 parts × 3 operators × 3 trials = 90 measurements

**Procedure**:
1. Select 10 parts spanning process range (consecutively produced preferred)
2. Number parts (1-10)
3. Operator A measures all 10 parts (Trial 1)
4. Operator A repeats (Trials 2 and 3)
5. Operator B measures all 10 parts (3 trials)
6. Operator C measures all 10 parts (3 trials)
7. Randomize measurement order (minimize bias)

**Analysis** (typically performed with software: Minitab, statistical calculators):
- Calculate repeatability (within-operator variation)
- Calculate reproducibility (between-operator variation)
- Calculate Gage R&R (total measurement system variation)
- Compare to total variation and tolerance

**Gage R&R Results**:

```
Gage R&R = √(Repeatability² + Reproducibility²)

%GRR = (Gage R&R / Total Variation) × 100
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **%GRR < 10%**: Acceptable measurement system
- **10% ≤ %GRR < 30%**: Marginal (may be acceptable depending on application)
- **%GRR ≥ 30%**: Unacceptable (improve measurement system)

**Alternative Criteria** (% of tolerance):
- **%GRR < 10% of tolerance**: Acceptable
- **10-30% of tolerance**: Marginal
- **>30% of tolerance**: Unacceptable

**Example Gage R&R Result**:
- %GRR = 15% (marginal)
- Repeatability = 12% (equipment variation dominates)
- Reproducibility = 5% (operators fairly consistent)
- **Interpretation**: Gage has excessive variation, primarily from equipment. **Action**: Investigate gage condition (worn anvils? Calibration issue?), consider better gage or measurement method.

#### Improving Measurement Systems

**If Gage R&R Unacceptable**:

**Repeatability Issues** (equipment variation):
- Check gage calibration
- Inspect gage for wear or damage (anvils, contacts)
- Improve gage resolution (finer increments)
- Use better quality gage (higher precision)
- Control environmental factors (temperature, vibration)
- Improve part clamping or fixturing (reduce setup variation)

**Reproducibility Issues** (operator variation):
- Improve measurement procedure (standardize technique)
- Provide training (consistent use of gage)
- Simplify measurement (reduce judgment)
- Use fixtures or guides (consistent part positioning)
- Automate measurement (CMM, vision system)

**Attribute Agreement Analysis**:
For attribute gages (go/no-go, pass/fail), use **Attribute Agreement Analysis**:
- Evaluate agreement among operators
- Evaluate agreement with known standard
- Metrics: % agreement, Kappa statistic

### 22.3.3.4 Statistical Process Control (SPC)

**SPC** uses statistical methods to monitor and control processes, detecting changes before defects are produced.

#### Control Charts

**Control Chart**: Graph of process data over time with control limits

**Purpose**:
- Distinguish common cause variation (inherent to process) from special cause variation (assignable cause)
- Detect process shifts or trends
- Determine when action needed (special cause) vs. leave alone (common cause)

**Control Chart Components**:
```
UCL (Upper Control Limit) -------------------- (statistical limit, typically ±3σ)
       •     •   •       •    •   •
       •   •       •   •        •
CL  (Center Line / Process Mean) ————————————
       •   •       •   •    •    •
       •     •   •       •    •
LCL (Lower Control Limit) --------------------

Time →
```

**Control Limits vs. Specification Limits**:
- **Control Limits**: Statistical limits based on process variation (±3 standard deviations from mean)
- **Specification Limits**: Customer requirements (tolerances on drawing)
- **Not the same**: Process can be in control but produce out-of-spec parts (Cpk <1.0)

#### Types of Control Charts

**Variable Data** (measured characteristics: length, weight, temperature):

**X-bar and R Chart** (most common):
- **X-bar chart**: Monitors process mean (average of subgroup)
- **R chart**: Monitors process variation (range of subgroup)
- Subgroup size: typically 4-5 parts

**X-bar and S Chart**:
- Similar to X-bar and R, but uses standard deviation (S) instead of range
- Preferred for larger subgroups (>10)

**Individuals (I) and Moving Range (MR) Chart**:
- For individual measurements (subgroup size = 1)
- Used when parts produced slowly or expensive to measure multiple

**Attribute Data** (count or proportion: defects, pass/fail):

**p-Chart**: Proportion defective (e.g., % scrap)

**np-Chart**: Number defective (e.g., defective parts per day)

**c-Chart**: Count of defects (e.g., scratches per panel)

**u-Chart**: Defects per unit (e.g., defects per 100 parts)

#### Control Chart Interpretation

**Process In Control**:
- Points randomly distributed around center line
- No points outside control limits
- No patterns or trends

**Process Out of Control** (special cause present):

**Rule 1**: One or more points beyond control limits (±3σ)
- **Action**: Investigate immediately, find cause, correct

**Rule 2**: 8 consecutive points on one side of center line
- **Action**: Process mean shifted, adjust process

**Rule 3**: 6 consecutive points increasing or decreasing (trend)
- **Action**: Tool wear, temperature drift, material change

**Rule 4**: 14 points alternating up and down (oscillation)
- **Action**: Systematic variation (two operators, two machines)

**Rule 5**: 2 out of 3 consecutive points beyond ±2σ (same side)
- **Action**: Process trending toward out-of-control

**Example Control Chart Analysis**:
```
UCL (+3σ) ----------------------------------------
                  •     •
       •   •   •    •        •
CL ————————————•———•———•————•———•————————————————
                    •
                       •  (point below LCL)
LCL (-3σ) ----------------------------------------

Interpretation: Point below LCL indicates special cause (e.g., incorrect setup, tool breakage, wrong material). **Action**: Stop production, investigate, correct problem, verify process back in control before resuming.
```

#### Implementing SPC

**Steps to Implement SPC**:

1. **Select Characteristics to Monitor**:
   - Critical dimensions (affecting fit, function, safety)
   - Characteristics with history of problems
   - Customer-specified requirements

2. **Select Control Chart Type**:
   - Variable or attribute data?
   - Subgroup size and frequency

3. **Collect Baseline Data**:
   - 20-25 subgroups minimum
   - Process stable and in control (no special causes)

4. **Calculate Control Limits**:
   - Use baseline data to compute mean and standard deviation
   - Calculate UCL, CL, LCL

5. **Plot and Monitor**:
   - Plot ongoing data
   - Check for out-of-control conditions
   - Investigate and correct special causes

6. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Narrow control limits as process improves
   - Reduce common cause variation (process improvement projects)

**Subgroup Frequency**:
- Depends on production rate and process stability
- Examples:
  - High-volume production: Every hour (subgroup of 5 parts)
  - Low-volume: Every shift or daily
  - Unstable process: More frequent (every setup, every 30 minutes)

**SPC Benefits**:
- Early detection of problems (before defects produced)
- Reduced scrap and rework
- Consistent quality
- Data-driven decisions (not gut feel)
- Documentation of process stability

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: AS9102 First Article Inspection

Create a simplified AS9102 Form 2 for a machined part:
1. Select a simple machined part (shaft, bushing, bracket)
2. List 10 characteristics from the drawing (dimensions, material, surface finish)
3. Create Form 2 with columns: Char #, Description, Requirement, Method, Results, Accept/Reject
4. Fill in inspection results (make up realistic data)
5. Identify any characteristics requiring Form 3 (material certs, heat treat, etc.)

### Exercise 2: Counterfeit Prevention Plan

Develop a counterfeit prevention plan for your shop:
1. Identify materials and parts at risk (purchased items, high-value, obsolete)
2. List authorized suppliers for each category
3. Define incoming inspection and verification procedures
4. Describe training for personnel (how to recognize counterfeits)
5. Define response process for suspect parts

### Exercise 3: APQP for New Product

Outline an APQP plan for a new product launch:
1. Choose a new product (machined component, assembly)
2. For each APQP phase, list key activities and deliverables
3. Identify special characteristics (critical dimensions, processes)
4. Create preliminary process flow diagram
5. Identify PPAP requirements (measurements, tests, capability studies)

### Exercise 4: Gage R&R Study

Conduct a simplified Gage R&R study:
1. Select a gage (micrometer, caliper, gage)
2. Select 5 parts spanning range
3. Have 2 operators measure each part 2 times (20 measurements total)
4. Record data in table
5. Calculate range for each operator and part
6. Estimate %GRR (use online calculator or simplified method)
7. Determine if measurement system acceptable

### Exercise 5: Control Chart

Create a control chart for a process:
1. Select a characteristic to monitor (diameter, length, surface finish)
2. Collect 20-25 subgroups of data (4-5 parts per subgroup)
3. Calculate X-bar and R for each subgroup
4. Calculate control limits (UCL, LCL) using formulas or software
5. Plot data on control chart
6. Interpret: Is process in control? Any special causes?
