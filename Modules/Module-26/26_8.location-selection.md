# Module 26 – CNC Business Ownership and Management


## Overview

Your facility is the physical foundation of your CNC business. The right location, size, layout, and infrastructure can significantly enhance productivity, safety, and profitability. Conversely, poor facility planning leads to inefficiency, safety hazards, growth limitations, and unnecessary costs.

This section covers location selection criteria, facility sizing and layout principles, lease versus buy decisions, utility and infrastructure requirements, safety compliance setup, and office/technology infrastructure. Whether you're converting a garage or leasing 10,000 square feet of industrial space, thoughtful facility planning is essential.

**Critical Reality:** Your first facility doesn't have to be perfect, but it must be adequate. Many successful shops start small and relocate as they grow. Plan for current needs plus 20-30% growth capacity.

## 8.1 Location Selection

### 8.1.1 Industrial Zoning Requirements

**Zoning Basics:**

Zoning laws regulate what types of businesses can operate in specific areas. Operating in the wrong zone can result in fines, shutdown orders, or inability to obtain permits.

**Common Zoning Categories:**

| Zoning Type | Manufacturing Allowed? | Notes |
|-------------|------------------------|-------|
| **Residential** | ❌ No | Illegal in most jurisdictions; even home-based CNC often prohibited |
| **Agricultural/Rural** | ⚠️ Sometimes | Varies widely; some allow light manufacturing, others don't |
| **Commercial** | ⚠️ Light Manufacturing | May allow small-scale, low-impact manufacturing; check local ordinances |
| **Light Industrial (M1, I-1)** | ✅ Yes | Typical for small CNC shops; allows manufacturing with some restrictions |
| **Heavy Industrial (M2, I-2)** | ✅ Yes | Full manufacturing allowed; fewer restrictions on noise, emissions, hours |
| **Mixed-Use** | ⚠️ Maybe | Depends on specific classification; usually limited |

**What to Verify:**

1. **Allowed Uses:** Is "metal fabrication," "precision machining," or "manufacturing" explicitly permitted?

2. **Performance Standards:**
   - Noise limits (dB at property line)
   - Hours of operation restrictions
   - Vibration limits
   - Hazardous materials storage limits
   - Emissions/air quality requirements

3. **Building Requirements:**
   - Fire suppression systems
   - Ventilation/exhaust requirements
   - Parking ratios (spaces per square foot)
   - Loading dock/truck access requirements

4. **Signage Restrictions:** Size, lighting, placement regulations

**How to Check Zoning:**

- Contact city/county planning department
- Request zoning verification letter
- Review municipal code online
- Hire zoning attorney if complex

**Home-Based CNC:**

Most jurisdictions **prohibit** or heavily restrict manufacturing in residential zones due to:
- Noise (machines, air compressor)
- Traffic (material deliveries, customer visits)
- Hazardous materials (coolants, solvents)
- Electrical load (often exceeds residential service)

**Exceptions:**
- Rural properties with agricultural zoning (sometimes)
- Conditional use permits (rare, discretionary)
- Very light hobby work (legally gray area)

**Reality:** If you're serious about a CNC business, plan for industrial-zoned space. Home-based is risky legally and limits growth.

### 8.1.2 Accessibility for Customers and Deliveries

**Material Deliveries:**

CNC shops receive frequent deliveries of heavy materials (steel, aluminum bars/sheets, castings).

**Requirements:**
- ✅ **Truck Access:** Can delivery trucks access the site? (Semi-trucks need wide turns, clearance)
- ✅ **Loading Area:** Space for trucks to park/unload safely
- ✅ **Loading Dock or Ground Level:** Forklift access or dock-height loading (48" typical)
- ✅ **Material Handling Path:** Clear path from delivery area to storage/machines

**Customer Access:**

Depending on business model, customers may visit to:
- Drop off/pick up parts
- Inspect work in progress
- Meet for consultations

**Considerations:**
- Proximity to customer base (shorter drive = more convenient)
- Visibility from main roads (if walk-in business)
- Professional appearance (customers judge quality by facility)
- Parking availability

**Supplier Proximity:**

Proximity to material suppliers, tooling distributors, and service providers (heat treat, plating, welding gases) reduces lead times and delivery costs.

**Example Trade-Offs:**

| Location | Rent | Customer Access | Supplier Proximity | Truck Access |
|----------|------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Downtown Industrial** | $$$ High | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Excellent | ⚠️ Limited (narrow streets) |
| **Suburban Industrial Park** | $$ Moderate | ✅ Good | ✅ Good | ✅ Excellent |
| **Rural/Exurban** | $ Low | ❌ Poor | ❌ Poor | ✅ Excellent |

**Most Small Shops:** Suburban industrial parks offer best balance of cost, access, and convenience.

### 8.1.3 Labor Pool Availability

**Workforce Considerations:**

If you plan to hire employees, consider local labor availability:

1. **Skilled Machinists:** Are there experienced machinists in the area? (Check local trade schools, competitors, manufacturing presence)

2. **Commute Distance:** Most employees unwilling to drive >30-45 minutes. Location determines hiring pool size.

3. **Wage Rates:** Local prevailing wages affect labor costs (urban areas typically higher than rural).

4. **Education/Training:** Proximity to technical colleges, apprenticeship programs, high schools with manufacturing programs.

**Example:**

- **Near manufacturing hub** (e.g., Grand Rapids, MI): Large pool of skilled machinists, competitive wages, easy hiring
- **Remote rural area**: Very limited skilled labor, may require training from scratch, employees may relocate frequently

**If Starting Solo:** Less critical initially, but consider future hiring needs.

### 8.1.4 Utility Requirements (Power, HVAC)

**Electrical Power:**

CNC machines require significant electrical power, typically **3-phase 208V or 480V**.

**Power Requirements by Shop Size:**

| Shop Size | Typical Power Need | Service Type |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Micro (1-2 machines)** | 60-100 amps, 208V 3-phase | 100A 3-phase service |
| **Small (2-3 machines)** | 100-200 amps, 208V/480V 3-phase | 200A 3-phase service |
| **Medium (4-6 machines)** | 200-400 amps, 480V 3-phase | 400A 3-phase service |
| **Large (7+ machines)** | 400+ amps, 480V 3-phase | 600-1000A 3-phase service |

**Checking Building Power:**

- Ask landlord/seller for electrical panel specs
- Verify voltage (208V, 240V, 480V) and amperage
- Check if 3-phase is available (most residential/light commercial is single-phase only)
- Determine if upgrades needed and who pays (tenant or landlord)

**Upgrading Electrical:**

If building lacks adequate power:
- **Cost:** $5,000-$50,000+ depending on distance to utility transformer, service size
- **Timeline:** 4-12 weeks (permitting, utility company work)
- **Negotiation:** Landlords sometimes cover upgrades or amortize cost into lease

**HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning):**

CNC machines generate heat. Comfortable temperature (for humans and dimensional accuracy) requires climate control.

**Heating:**
- Natural gas or propane heaters (common in industrial spaces)
- Forced air or radiant heating
- Cost: $2,000-$20,000 depending on size and climate

**Cooling:**
- Mini-split AC systems (ductless): $3,000-$10,000 per zone
- Central AC: $10,000-$40,000+ for large spaces
- Evaporative coolers (swamp coolers): Budget option in dry climates ($1,000-$3,000)

**Ventilation:**
- Exhaust fans to remove coolant mist, heat, fumes
- Fresh air makeup (to replace exhausted air)
- Cost: $2,000-$10,000

**Climate Considerations:**
- **Hot climates:** AC essential (both comfort and dimensional stability)
- **Cold climates:** Heating essential (machines, coolant, human comfort)
- **Humid climates:** Dehumidification prevents rust on raw materials and machines

### 8.1.5 Cost Considerations

**Lease Rates by Region (Typical Industrial Space):**

| Region Type | Cost per Sq Ft/Year | Example (2,500 sq ft) |
|-------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Rural/Small Town** | $3-6/sq ft/year | $625-1,250/month |
| **Suburban** | $6-10/sq ft/year | $1,250-2,100/month |
| **Urban/Metro** | $10-18/sq ft/year | $2,100-3,750/month |
| **High-Cost Metro (CA, NY)** | $15-30/sq ft/year | $3,125-6,250/month |

**Additional Costs:**

- **CAM (Common Area Maintenance):** $1-3/sq ft/year (landscaping, parking lot, shared utilities)
- **Property Taxes:** Usually passed through to tenant (pro-rata)
- **Insurance:** Landlord requires tenant liability insurance
- **Utilities:** Tenant pays (electric, gas, water, trash)

**Example Total Occupancy Cost:**

```
2,500 sq ft space @ $8/sq ft/year
Base rent: $1,667/month
CAM: $300/month
Property tax pass-through: $150/month
Insurance: $200/month
Utilities (electric, gas, water): $600/month
TOTAL: $2,917/month ($35,000/year)
```

**Lease vs. Own:**

| Factor | Lease | Own |
|--------|-------|-----|
| **Upfront Cost** | Low (deposits: 2-3 months rent) | High ($40K-$240K down payment) |
| **Monthly Cost** | Rent (fixed or escalating) | Mortgage (fixed) + taxes/insurance |
| **Flexibility** | Can relocate easily | Difficult/expensive to sell |
| **Equity** | None (expense) | Build equity |
| **Maintenance** | Landlord responsible (usually) | Owner responsible |
| **Tax Deduction** | Rent fully deductible | Mortgage interest + depreciation deductible |

**Most Startups:** Lease initially (preserve capital, maintain flexibility), consider buying after 5-10 years if established and location works long-term.

## 8.2 Facility Size and Layout

### 8.2.1 Space Requirements per Machine

**General Rule of Thumb:**

**400-800 square feet per CNC machine** (includes machine footprint, chip management, tooling storage, work area).

**Breakdown:**

| Machine Size | Footprint | Clearance/Work Area | Total Space Needed |
|--------------|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Small VMC (Haas VF-2)** | 8' × 7' = 56 sq ft | 12' × 14' | 170-200 sq ft |
| **Medium VMC (Haas VF-4)** | 10' × 8' = 80 sq ft | 16' × 16' | 250-300 sq ft |
| **Large VMC (Haas VF-6)** | 12' × 9' = 108 sq ft | 20' × 18' | 360-400 sq ft |
| **CNC Lathe (Haas TL-2)** | 10' × 6' = 60 sq ft | 14' × 12' | 170-200 sq ft |
| **Large Lathe (Haas ST-40)** | 16' × 7' = 112 sq ft | 20' × 14' | 280-320 sq ft |

**Additional Space Needs:**

- **Support Equipment:** Bandsaws, grinders, benches, tool crib (200-400 sq ft)
- **Raw Material Storage:** Vertical bar racks, sheet racks (200-600 sq ft)
- **Finished Goods/WIP:** Shelving, carts, staging (200-500 sq ft)
- **Inspection Area:** CMM or inspection bench, gauge storage (100-200 sq ft)
- **Office:** Desk, computer, filing, conference area (150-400 sq ft)
- **Break Room/Restroom:** (100-200 sq ft if not included)
- **Aisles and Circulation:** 20-30% of total machine/work area

**Example Space Calculation (Small Shop):**

```
2 VMCs (VF-3 size): 2 × 250 sq ft = 500 sq ft
1 CNC Lathe: 200 sq ft
Support equipment: 300 sq ft
Material storage: 400 sq ft
Office: 200 sq ft
Break room: 100 sq ft
Aisles (25%): 425 sq ft
TOTAL: 2,125 sq ft

Recommended: 2,500-3,000 sq ft (buffer for growth)
```

### 8.2.2 Workflow and Material Flow

**Efficient Layout Principles:**

1. **Linear Flow:** Material enters → machining → inspection → shipping (minimize backtracking)

2. **Grouping Similar Functions:** All mills together, lathes together (operator efficiency)

3. **High-Traffic Areas:** Locate frequently accessed items (tooling, common materials) centrally

4. **Safety Clearances:** Ensure clear paths around machines, emergency exits unobstructed

**Common Layouts:**

**U-Shaped Layout:**

```
[Receiving] → [Raw Material Storage]
                    ↓
[Shipping] ← [Inspection] ← [Machines] → [Support Equipment]
                    ↑
             [Finished Storage]
```

**Advantages:** Efficient flow, shipping/receiving near each other, compact

**L-Shaped Layout:**

```
[Receiving/Shipping] → [Raw Material]
         ↓
    [Machines] → [Support] → [Inspection]
         ↓
  [Finished Goods]
```

**Advantages:** Good for rectangular buildings, clear separation of functions

**Open Floor Plan:**

```
All machines in open area, support functions around perimeter
```

**Advantages:** Flexibility, easy reconfiguration, visibility

**Material Handling:**

- **Forklift Access:** 12-14 ft aisle widths for forklift operation
- **Carts and Dollies:** Smaller aisles (6-8 ft) acceptable
- **Overhead Crane:** Useful for heavy parts/materials (5,000-10,000 lb capacity), cost $10K-40K installed

### 8.2.3 Office and Support Areas

**Office Needs:**

- **Programming Station:** Computer, dual monitors, CAM software (quiet area preferable)
- **Desk/Administration:** Quoting, bookkeeping, phone calls
- **Meeting Area:** Small table for customer/supplier meetings
- **File Storage:** Paper documents, binders, samples

**Size:**
- Micro shop: 100-150 sq ft (one desk, programming station)
- Small shop: 200-300 sq ft (separate programming and admin desks, small meeting area)
- Medium shop: 400-600 sq ft (multiple offices, conference room)

**Support Areas:**

- **Break Room:** Refrigerator, microwave, table, sink (if employees; 100-150 sq ft)
- **Restroom:** Required by code; verify adequate facilities (1-2 restrooms depending on employee count)
- **Tool Crib:** Organized storage for tooling, holders, inserts, measuring tools (100-300 sq ft)
- **Maintenance Area:** Bench for tool assembly, presetter, cleaning (100-200 sq ft)

### 8.2.4 Growth and Expansion Space

**Plan for Growth:**

Don't size facility to exact current needs. Allow room for:

- **1-2 Additional Machines:** Even if not purchased immediately
- **Increased Material Storage:** As business grows, inventory grows
- **Employees:** Additional workstations, break areas

**Example:**

If you have 2 machines now, lease 3,000-3,500 sq ft instead of 2,000 sq ft. The extra cost is modest ($500-1,000/month), but allows growth without relocating.

**Relocating is Expensive:**

- Moving equipment ($5K-20K)
- Downtime (1-4 weeks lost production)
- Facility improvement costs at new location
- Customer/supplier notification

**Better:** Lease slightly more space upfront, grow into it.

## 8.3 Lease vs. Buy Facility

### Leasing (Most Common for Startups)

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Low upfront cost (2-3 months rent vs. 20% down payment)
- ✅ Flexibility to relocate/expand
- ✅ Landlord handles building maintenance (roof, structure, parking lot)
- ✅ Preserve capital for equipment and working capital
- ✅ Rent fully tax-deductible

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ No equity building
- ❌ Rent increases over time
- ❌ Landlord approval for modifications
- ❌ Lease obligations (can't easily exit if business struggles)

**Lease Types:**

**Triple Net (NNN) Lease:**
- Tenant pays base rent + property taxes + insurance + maintenance (CAM)
- Most common for industrial properties
- Tenant responsible for most costs

**Gross Lease:**
- Tenant pays fixed rent, landlord covers taxes, insurance, maintenance
- Less common for industrial; more common for office

**Modified Gross:**
- Hybrid; some costs included, others passed through

**Lease Terms:**

- **Length:** 3-5 years typical (sometimes 1-2 years for startups)
- **Escalations:** Rent increases 2-4% annually or fixed increases
- **Renewal Options:** Right to renew at predetermined rate or market rate
- **Tenant Improvements (TI):** Landlord may contribute $5-20/sq ft for improvements
- **Early Termination:** Usually not allowed without penalty

**Negotiation Tips:**

1. **Negotiate TI Allowance:** Ask landlord to contribute to electrical upgrades, HVAC, office build-out
2. **First Month Free:** Common concession (especially in soft markets)
3. **Renewal Options:** Lock in renewal terms to avoid huge increases
4. **Cap on CAM:** Negotiate cap on CAM increases
5. **Early Termination Clause:** If possible, negotiate right to terminate with 6-12 months notice

### Buying (Long-Term Investment)

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Build equity (mortgage principal paydown + appreciation)
- ✅ Fixed monthly cost (principal + interest + taxes/insurance)
- ✅ No landlord restrictions on modifications
- ✅ Can sell or lease to others later
- ✅ Tax benefits (mortgage interest, depreciation)

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Large down payment (20% = $40K-$200K+)
- ❌ Illiquid asset (can't easily sell quickly)
- ❌ Maintenance responsibility (roof, HVAC, parking lot)
- ❌ Property tax risk (increases over time)
- ❌ Less flexibility to relocate

**When to Buy:**

- Business established (5-10+ years, stable cash flow)
- Confident in long-term location
- Have capital for down payment without depleting reserves
- Real estate market favorable
- Building equity aligns with retirement/exit strategy

**Financing:**

- **SBA 504 Loan:** 10-15% down, long terms (20-25 years), favorable rates
- **Conventional Commercial Mortgage:** 20-30% down, 5-20 year terms
- **Seller Financing:** Sometimes available (seller acts as bank)

**Example:**

```
Building: $600,000 (4,000 sq ft)
Down payment (20%): $120,000
Loan: $480,000 @ 7%, 20-year term
Monthly payment: $3,720 (principal + interest)
Property taxes: $600/month
Insurance: $300/month
Maintenance reserve: $400/month
TOTAL: $5,020/month

Compare to leasing 4,000 sq ft @ $8/sq ft/year = $2,667/month base rent + $800 CAM/taxes = $3,467/month

Buying costs $1,553/month more BUT building equity of ~$1,500/month (principal paydown) + appreciation.
```

**Most Startups:** Lease initially, buy later if business is stable and location is long-term.

## 8.4 Utilities and Infrastructure

### 8.4.1 Electrical Requirements (Phase, Voltage, Amperage)

**Understanding Electrical Service:**

**Single-Phase vs. Three-Phase:**

- **Single-Phase:** Residential/light commercial (120V/240V)
- **Three-Phase:** Industrial (208V, 240V, 480V)

**Why CNC Machines Need Three-Phase:**

- More efficient power delivery for motors
- Smoother operation (constant power vs. pulsing)
- Most CNC machines designed for 3-phase

**Voltage Options:**

| Voltage | Common Usage | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| **208V 3-phase** | Light industrial, small CNC machines | Lower voltage, smaller machines |
| **240V 3-phase** | Less common (mostly international) | Similar to 208V |
| **480V 3-phase** | Heavy industrial, larger CNC machines | More efficient for high-power machines |

**Machine Requirements (Examples):**

| Machine | Voltage | Amperage | Circuit Breaker |
|---------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| Haas VF-2 | 208V 3-phase | 30A | 40A |
| Haas VF-4 | 208V or 480V 3-phase | 30A (480V) or 50A (208V) | 40A or 60A |
| Haas TL-2 | 208V 3-phase | 30A | 40A |
| Air Compressor (10HP) | 208V or 480V 3-phase | 30-40A | 50A |

**Calculating Total Service Needs:**

Don't add up all machine nameplate amps (they don't all draw max simultaneously). Use **demand factor**:

```
Example (Small Shop):
- 2 VMCs: 50A each = 100A nameplate
- 1 Lathe: 30A nameplate
- Air compressor: 35A nameplate
- Lighting, HVAC: 20A
TOTAL Nameplate: 185A

Demand factor: 60-70% (machines rarely all at max load)
Actual demand: 185A × 0.65 = 120A

Recommended service: 200A (25-30% cushion for growth)
```

**Electrician and Permits:**

- Hire licensed electrician for machine hookups
- Permits required for new circuits, service upgrades
- Cost: $500-2,000 per machine hookup

- Output: 18-38 CFM @ 90-125 PSI
- Cost: $3,000-8,000

**Medium Shop (4-6 machines):**
- **10-15 HP rotary screw compressor**
- Output: 38-54 CFM @ 90-125 PSI
- Cost: $8,000-15,000

**Rotary Screw vs. Piston:**

| Type | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|------|------|------|----------|
| **Rotary Screw** | ✅ Continuous duty, quieter, more efficient | ❌ Higher cost | Shops running 8+ hours/day |
| **Piston (Reciprocating)** | ✅ Lower cost | ❌ Noisy, duty cycle limits (50-60%), more maintenance | Light use, budget-conscious |

**Air Dryer:**

Essential for CNC (prevents moisture in air lines that can damage machines, rust parts).

- **Refrigerated dryer:** $1,000-3,000 (most common)
- **Desiccant dryer:** $3,000-8,000 (better, for critical applications)

**Air Distribution:**

- Hard-piped aluminum or copper lines (avoid rubber hose long runs)
- Drops at each machine with shutoff valves
- Filter-regulator-lubricator (FRL) at each machine
- Cost: $1,500-5,000 for small shop piping

### 8.4.3 HVAC and Climate Control

**Temperature Control Importance:**

1. **Dimensional Accuracy:** Aluminum expands ~0.001" per inch per 50°F change. Temperature swings cause dimensional errors.

2. **Machine Performance:** Electronics and hydraulics have optimal temperature ranges.

3. **Employee Comfort:** Productivity and morale depend on comfortable temperatures.

**Target Temperature:**

## Conclusion

Facility planning directly impacts productivity, safety, profitability, and growth potential. Thoughtful location selection, adequate size, efficient layout, proper utilities, and compliance setup create a foundation for success.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Zoning Matters:** Verify industrial zoning before signing lease. Operating in wrong zone risks shutdown.

2. **Location Trade-Offs:** Balance rent cost, customer/supplier access, labor pool, and utilities. Suburban industrial parks often best for small shops.

3. **Size for Growth:** Lease 20-30% more space than current needs. Relocating is expensive and disruptive.

4. **Lease First, Buy Later:** Preserve capital by leasing initially. Buy once established (5-10+ years).

5. **Electrical is Critical:** Verify 3-phase power availability before committing to facility. Upgrades are expensive and time-consuming.

6. **Climate Control:** Temperature stability matters for dimensional accuracy. Budget for adequate HVAC.

7. **Efficient Layout:** Plan workflow (receiving → machining → inspection → shipping) to minimize wasted motion and time.

8. **Safety Compliance:** Budget for fire extinguishers, exits, lighting, PPE. OSHA violations are costly.

9. **Technology Infrastructure:** Invest in reliable computers, network, internet, and backup systems. Data loss is catastrophic.

10. **Facility Improvements:** Negotiate tenant improvement allowance from landlord. Upgrades (electrical, HVAC, lighting) add up quickly ($10K-50K+).

**Your facility is your business's physical home. Get it right, and operations flow smoothly. Get it wrong, and you'll fight inefficiency, safety hazards, and limitations daily. Plan carefully.**
