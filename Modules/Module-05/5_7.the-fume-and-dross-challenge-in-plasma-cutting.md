# Module 5 – Plasma Cutting

## 7. Table Design: Water vs. Downdraft Trade-offs for Fume Control and Part Cooling

### 7.1 The Fume and Dross Challenge in Plasma Cutting

Plasma cutting generates three primary contaminants that must be managed for operator safety and equipment longevity:

1. **Metal fumes:** Vaporized metal oxides (primarily iron oxide from steel, aluminum oxide from aluminum) at 0.1–1 μm particle size. OSHA permissible exposure limit (PEL) for iron oxide fume: 10 mg/m³ (8-hour TWA). Without ventilation, plasma cutting exceeds this limit by 10–50×.

2. **UV and visible light radiation:** Arc temperature (20,000–30,000 K) produces intense UV radiation (200–400 nm wavelength), causing arc eye (photokeratitis) in unprotected operators. UV intensity: 10–100 mW/cm² at 1 m distance.

3. **Dross:** Molten metal expelled from the kerf solidifies on the underside of the cut as slag (dross). Dross buildup on table slats interferes with torch height sensing and creates part support irregularities.

The cutting table serves dual roles: **supporting the workpiece** during cutting and **capturing/removing fumes and dross** to maintain a safe work environment. Two fundamental approaches dominate industrial practice: **water tables** and **downdraft tables**.

### 7.2 Water Table Design: Submersion for Fume Suppression

Water tables position the workpiece just above a water-filled tank. The plasma arc exits the bottom of the cut and penetrates into the water, where the molten metal and metal vapors are quenched and captured.

**Operating Principle:**

The water surface sits 50–75 mm below the workpiece top surface. As the arc penetrates through the material (typically 3–6 mm below the bottom surface for complete severance), it enters the water. The water:

1. **Cools and solidifies dross:** Molten metal particles quench instantly, forming solid dross that settles to the tank bottom.
2. **Absorbs fumes:** Metal vapor condenses into fine particles, which are trapped in the water column rather than dispersing into the air.
3. **Suppresses UV radiation:** Water absorbs UV photons, reducing radiant exposure by 90–95%.
4. **Reduces noise:** Acoustic energy from the arc (90–110 dB) is attenuated by 10–20 dB when the arc terminates in water.

**Water Level Calculation:**

For a table with slat spacing $s$ and workpiece thickness $t$, the water must be high enough that the arc penetrates into water regardless of kerf location:

$$h_{\text{water}} = h_{\text{slat}} - \left( t + d_{\text{pierce}} \right) - \Delta h_{\text{safety}}$$

where:
- $h_{\text{slat}}$ = slat top surface height above tank bottom
- $t$ = material thickness
- $d_{\text{pierce}}$ = arc penetration depth (typically 3–6 mm for plasma)
- $\Delta h_{\text{safety}}$ = safety margin to ensure arc-in-water (25–50 mm)

**Example 7.1: Water Level for 10 mm Steel Cutting**

**Given:**
- Slat height: 125 mm
- Material thickness: 10 mm
- Pierce depth: 5 mm
- Safety margin: 40 mm

**Calculate required water level:**

$$h_{\text{water}} = 125 - (10 + 5) - 40 = 70 \text{ mm}$$

**Answer:** Maintain water level at 70 mm above tank bottom (55 mm below slat tops).

**Water Quality Management:**

Dross accumulation and dissolved metal salts degrade water over time. Water management strategies:

- **pH control:** Steel cutting produces acidic water (pH 4–6) due to iron oxide formation. Maintain pH 7–9 via sodium bicarbonate addition (baking soda) to prevent corrosion of tank walls.
- **Dross settling:** Allow 24–48 hours settling time before removing dross. Fine particles (<10 μm) remain suspended; add flocculating agent (aluminum sulfate, 50–100 g per 1000 L) to aggregate particles for settling.
- **Water replacement schedule:** Replace 10–20% of water volume monthly; full replacement every 6–12 months depending on cutting volume.

### 7.3 Downdraft Table Design: Fan-Driven Fume Extraction

Downdraft tables use high-velocity airflow to pull fumes and dross downward through slats or grating into a plenum chamber beneath the table. An exhaust fan connected to the plenum draws contaminated air through filters before discharging to atmosphere or recirculating.

**Airflow Requirements:**

Effective fume capture requires air velocity at the workpiece surface sufficient to overcome the upward buoyancy of hot fumes. The **capture velocity** must exceed the thermal plume rise velocity:

$$v_{\text{capture}} \geq 1.5 \times v_{\text{plume}}$$

where $v_{\text{plume}} \approx 1.5$–2.5 m/s for plasma cutting (function of arc power and ambient temperature).

**Design target:** Capture velocity $v_{\text{capture}} = 3$–4 m/s at the workpiece surface.

**Fan Sizing Calculation:**

Required volumetric flow rate:

$$\dot{V} = v_{\text{capture}} \times A_{\text{table}}$$

where $A_{\text{table}}$ is the total table area (m²).

**Example 7.2: Downdraft Fan Sizing for 1.2m × 2.4m Table**

**Given:**
- Table dimensions: 1.2 m × 2.4 m
- Target capture velocity: 3.5 m/s

**Calculate required airflow:**

$$A_{\text{table}} = 1.2 \times 2.4 = 2.88 \text{ m}^2$$

$$\dot{V} = 3.5 \times 2.88 = 10.08 \text{ m}^3/\text{s} = 605 \text{ m}^3/\text{min}$$

Convert to CFM (common fan rating unit):

$$\dot{V}_{\text{CFM}} = 605 \times 35.3 = 21,357 \text{ CFM}$$

**Fan selection:** Industrial centrifugal fan rated ≥22,000 CFM at 3–5 inches H₂O static pressure (accounts for filter pressure drop and ductwork losses).

**Typical power:** 7.5–15 HP (5.5–11 kW) motor for this airflow.

**Filter Selection:**

Downdraft tables require filtration to prevent metal particulate from entering the fan (causing blade erosion) and from being exhausted to atmosphere (violating air quality regulations).

| Filter Type | Particle Capture | Pressure Drop | Lifespan (Hours) | Cost per Filter |
|-------------|------------------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Cartridge (pleated paper)** | 95% @ 1 μm | 2–4" H₂O | 300–800 | $50–$150 |
| **Baghouse (fabric bags)** | 99% @ 0.5 μm | 4–6" H₂O | 1,000–2,000 | $200–$400 |
| **HEPA (cleanroom grade)** | 99.97% @ 0.3 μm | 6–10" H₂O | 500–1,000 | $300–$600 |

**Trade-off:** Cartridge filters offer lowest cost but require frequent replacement (every 100–300 cutting hours). Baghouse filters balance efficiency and cost for high-volume operations.

### 7.4 Comparative Analysis: Water vs. Downdraft

| Parameter | Water Table | Downdraft Table | Advantage |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Fume capture efficiency** | 90–98% (fumes trapped in water) | 70–90% (depends on airflow) | **Water superior** |
| **UV suppression** | 90–95% (water absorbs UV) | 0% (requires enclosure) | **Water superior** |
| **Noise reduction** | 10–20 dB (water dampens arc) | 0 dB (plus fan noise +5–10 dB) | **Water superior** |
| **Part cooling** | Excellent (water contact cools parts to touch-safe in 30–60 s) | Poor (air cooling only, 10–20 min) | **Water superior** |
| **Thin material support** | Difficult (warped sheets sag between slats) | Excellent (grating provides continuous support) | **Downdraft superior** |
| **Aluminum cutting** | Problematic (hydrogen gas generation risk) | Safe (no chemical reactions) | **Downdraft superior** |
| **Maintenance** | Water quality management, dross removal | Filter replacement, fan maintenance | **Comparable** |
| **Operating cost** | Low (water + treatment chemicals) | Moderate (filters + electricity) | **Water lower** |
| **Capital cost** | Low ($500–$2,000 for 1.2×2.4m tank) | High ($5,000–$15,000 for fan + filters) | **Water lower** |

**Decision Matrix:**

**Choose Water Table if:**
- Cutting primarily mild steel (no aluminum)
- Material thickness >3 mm (rigid enough to span slats)
- Budget-constrained (<$5,000 total system cost)
- High-volume production (operating cost matters)
- Noise and UV exposure are concerns

**Choose Downdraft Table if:**
- Cutting thin sheet metal (<3 mm) requiring continuous support
- Cutting aluminum (avoids hydrogen gas hazard)
- Willing to invest in higher capital cost for cleaner operation
- Able to manage filter replacement logistics

### 7.5 Slat and Grating Specifications

Both table types require material support structures that allow fumes/dross to pass through while supporting the workpiece.

**Slat Design (Water Tables):**

- **Material:** Mild steel angle iron (L 25×25×3 mm) or square tube (20×20×2 mm)
- **Spacing:** 30–50 mm on center (narrower for thin materials)
- **Length:** Full table width; removable for dross cleaning
- **Coating:** None (consumable; replace when warped from heat)

**Grating Design (Downdraft Tables):**

- **Type:** Expanded metal grating or perforated plate
- **Open area:** 60–75% (balance between support and airflow)
- **Perforation size:** 6–12 mm diameter holes or diamond mesh
- **Material:** Mild steel (1018) 3–5 mm thick; stainless for longevity

### 7.6 Hybrid Designs and Emerging Technologies

**Wet Downdraft Tables:**

Combine water bath with fan extraction. Water captures dross and heavy particles; fan removes residual fumes. Achieves 95–99% fume capture efficiency but requires both water management and filter replacement. Capital cost: 1.5–2× standard water table.

**Disposable Water Additive Systems:**

Add polymer beads (PVA or acrylic) to water tank. Beads encapsulate dross and fumes, forming a gel layer on the water surface. Replace gel layer monthly instead of water. Reduces water disposal costs but increases consumable costs ($50–$100/month additive).

### 7.7 Regulatory Compliance and Safety Considerations

**OSHA Ventilation Requirements (29 CFR 1910.252):**

Plasma cutting in enclosed spaces requires mechanical ventilation if natural ventilation is insufficient to maintain metal fume concentration <10 mg/m³ (iron oxide PEL).

**EPA Emissions (40 CFR Part 63, Subpart XXXXXX):**

Metal fabrication shops must limit particulate emissions to <0.01 gr/dscf (grains per dry standard cubic foot). Downdraft tables with baghouse or cartridge filters meet this standard; water tables require settling tanks to prevent particulate carryover in evaporated water.

**Hydrogen Gas Hazard (Aluminum + Water):**

Molten aluminum reacts with water to produce hydrogen gas:

$$2 \text{Al} + 3 \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{Al}_2\text{O}_3 + 3 \text{H}_2 \uparrow$$

Hydrogen is flammable at 4–75% concentration in air. Risk mitigation: **never use water tables for aluminum cutting**, or ensure continuous forced ventilation (>10 air changes/hour) to prevent hydrogen accumulation.

### 7.8 Summary and Best Practices

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Water tables excel for steel cutting:** 90–98% fume capture, excellent UV suppression, low cost. Maintain water level 40–60 mm below slat tops for optimal performance.

2. **Downdraft tables required for thin sheet and aluminum:** Continuous support from grating prevents warping; avoids aluminum-water reaction hazard. Size fan for 3–4 m/s capture velocity (21,000 CFM for 1.2×2.4m table).

3. **Operating cost differs significantly:** Water table: $20–$50/month (water + chemicals). Downdraft: $100–$300/month (filters) + $50–$150/month (electricity).

4. **Regulatory compliance mandatory:** OSHA requires fume control (<10 mg/m³); EPA limits particulate emissions. Both table types can comply if properly maintained.

5. **Maintenance schedules critical:** Water tables: monthly dross removal, quarterly water replacement. Downdraft: filter inspection every 50–100 cutting hours; replacement when pressure drop >150% of clean filter value.

Proper table design and maintenance ensure operator safety, part quality, and regulatory compliance while managing long-term operating costs.
