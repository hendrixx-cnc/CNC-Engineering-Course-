# Module 24 – L.E.A.N. Strategies for CNC Manufacturing


## 24.5.1 Introduction to Kanban

**Kanban** (Japanese: 看板) literally means "signboard" or "visual card."

In Lean manufacturing, **Kanban is a pull system tool that uses visual signals to trigger production or movement of materials.**

### Origin

**Taiichi Ohno** developed Kanban at Toyota in the 1950s, inspired by American supermarkets:

**Observation:**
- Supermarket shelves stocked with products
- Customers take what they need
- Store restocks based on what was consumed
- No overproduction, minimal inventory

**Application to Manufacturing:**
- "Supermarket" of parts between operations
- Downstream "customer" takes what's needed
- Kanban signal triggers upstream to replenish
- Self-regulating inventory system

### Core Principles

**1. Visual Management:**
- Status visible at a glance
- No need to check computer systems
- Anyone can understand

**2. Pull Production:**
- Actual consumption authorizes production
- No production without signal
- Prevents overproduction

**3. Inventory Control:**
- Limits WIP to Kanban quantity
- Can't produce more than authorized
- Right-sized inventory

**4. Continuous Flow:**
- Smooth replenishment
- No large batches
- Responsive to demand

**5. Continuous Improvement:**
- Reduce Kanban quantity over time
- Expose problems
- Drive improvement

## 24.5.2 Types of Kanban

### 24.5.2.1 Production Kanban

**Production Kanban (P-Kanban):** Signal authorizing production of parts.

**Function:**
- Instructs upstream process to produce
- Specifies what, how many, when
- Attached to container of parts

**Information on Card:**
- Part number and description
- Quantity per container
- Producing work center
- Storage location
- Card number (e.g., 3 of 5)

**Example Production Kanban:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  PRODUCTION KANBAN              │
│                                 │
│  Part No: 12345-B               │
│  Description: Shaft, Steel      │
│                                 │
│  Quantity: 25 pcs               │
│                                 │
│  Produce At: CNC Cell 3         │
│  Store At: Rack A-12            │
│                                 │
│  Card: 2 of 4                   │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Flow:**
1. Downstream consumes parts from supermarket
2. Production Kanban removed, goes to producing cell
3. Cell produces one container (25 pcs)
4. Kanban attached to full container
5. Container returned to supermarket
6. Cycle repeats

### 24.5.2.2 Withdrawal Kanban

**Withdrawal Kanban (W-Kanban):** Signal authorizing movement of parts.

**Function:**
- Authorizes material handler to move parts
- From one location to another
- Specifies what, how many, from where, to where

**Information on Card:**
- Part number and description
- Quantity
- Supplying location
- Consuming location
- Delivery frequency

**Example Withdrawal Kanban:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  WITHDRAWAL KANBAN              │
│                                 │
│  Part No: 12345-B               │
│  Description: Shaft, Steel      │
│                                 │
│  Quantity: 25 pcs               │
│                                 │
│  From: CNC Cell 3, Rack A-12    │
│  To: Assembly Cell 2            │
│                                 │
│  Delivery: Every 2 hours        │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Flow:**
1. Assembly consumes parts
2. Withdrawal Kanban goes to material handler
3. Material handler takes card to CNC supermarket
4. Exchanges withdrawal Kanban for production Kanban
5. Takes full container to assembly
6. Returns production Kanban to CNC cell

### 24.5.2.3 Supplier Kanban

**Supplier Kanban:** Signal for external supplier to deliver parts.

**Function:**
- Extends pull system to suppliers
- Frequent small deliveries
- Eliminates large inventory

**Information on Card:**
- Part number
- Quantity per delivery
- Delivery frequency
- Supplier contact
- Delivery location

**Example:**
- 500 bolts per day consumption
- Kanban quantity: 100 bolts
- **5 Kanban cards circulating**
- Supplier delivers 100 when receives Kanban (daily)

**Benefits:**
- Reduced raw material inventory
- Supplier visibility to consumption
- Smooth, predictable deliveries
- Partnership vs. adversarial

## 24.5.4 Calculating Kanban Quantities

**How many Kanban cards are needed?**

### Formula

**Number of Kanbans = (Demand During Lead Time + Safety Stock) ÷ Container Quantity**

**Where:**
- **Demand During Lead Time** = Daily demand × Lead time (days)
- **Safety Stock** = Buffer for variation (typically 10-20% of demand during lead time)
- **Container Quantity** = Standard container size

### Example Calculation

**Given:**
- Daily demand: 200 parts
- Replenishment lead time: 0.5 days (4 hours)
- Safety stock: 20% (to handle variation)
- Container capacity: 25 parts

**Calculate:**

**Demand During Lead Time:**
- 200 parts/day × 0.5 days = 100 parts

**Safety Stock:**
- 100 parts × 20% = 20 parts

**Total Inventory Needed:**
- 100 + 20 = 120 parts

**Number of Kanbans:**
- 120 parts ÷ 25 parts/container = 4.8
- **Round up to 5 Kanbans**

**Inventory Level:**
- 5 Kanbans × 25 parts = **125 parts maximum**

### Factors Affecting Quantity

**Lead Time:**
- Longer lead time = more Kanbans
- **Reduce lead time to reduce inventory**

**Demand Variation:**
- High variation = more safety stock
- **Level demand (heijunka) to reduce Kanbans**

**Container Size:**
- Larger containers = fewer Kanbans
- But less frequent replenishment
- **Right-size containers**

**Reliability:**
- Unreliable processes = more safety stock
- **Improve reliability to reduce Kanbans**

### Continuous Improvement

**Start Conservative:**
- Calculate Kanbans with 20% safety stock
- Ensure system works smoothly

**Gradually Reduce:**
- After system stable, reduce to 4 Kanbans
- Observe for stockouts
- If OK, reduce to 3
- **Expose problems, solve them, reduce again**

**Goal:**
- Minimize inventory
- Maintain flow
- Never stop reducing

## 24.5.5 Two-Bin Kanban Systems

**Simplest Kanban implementation:** Two bins for each part.

### How It Works

**Setup:**
- Two identical containers (bins) per part
- Each bin holds enough for lead time + safety stock
- When bin empty, triggers reorder

**Operation:**

**Bin 1 (In Use):**
- Consume parts from Bin 1
- Bin 2 sits full (inventory)

**Bin 1 Empty:**
- Trigger: Empty bin signals replenishment needed
- Action: Send Bin 1 to be refilled (or place reorder card)
- Switch to Bin 2

**While Using Bin 2:**
- Bin 1 being refilled
- Must fill Bin 1 before Bin 2 empty
- If Bin 2 empties before Bin 1 refilled = stockout (problem!)

**Bin 1 Refilled:**
- Return to use, Bin 2 becomes inventory
- Cycle repeats

### Benefits

**Simple:**
- No cards needed
- Easy to understand
- Self-evident

**Visual:**
- Empty bin obvious
- No tracking required

**Effective:**
- Prevents stockouts (if sized correctly)
- Limits inventory (only 2 bins worth)

### Sizing Two-Bin

**Bin Capacity:**
- Must hold demand during replenishment lead time + safety stock
- Same calculation as Kanban

**Example:**
- Daily usage: 50 bolts
- Lead time: 2 days (to reorder and receive)
- Safety stock: 20%
- **Bin size: (50 × 2) × 1.2 = 120 bolts**
- **Two bins = 240 bolts maximum inventory**

### Best Applications

**Two-Bin Ideal For:**
- Small, inexpensive parts (fasteners, consumables)
- Stable demand
- Simple replenishment (supplier or internal)
- Limited SKUs

**Not Ideal For:**
- Large, expensive parts
- Complex manufacturing
- Many SKUs (racks of bins needed)
- Tight space constraints

## 24.5.6 Electronic Kanban (e-Kanban)

**e-Kanban:** Electronic signals replace physical cards.

### Technology

**Systems:**
- Barcode scanning
- RFID tags
- MES/ERP integration
- Visual displays
- Email/text alerts

**Example Flow:**
1. Operator scans empty container barcode
2. System sends signal to upstream cell
3. Upstream cell receives production order on screen
4. Produces parts
5. Scans completed
6. System updates inventory

### Benefits

**Real-Time Visibility:**

## 24.5.7 Kanban for Raw Materials

**Applying Kanban to supplier deliveries.**

### Internal Raw Material Kanban

**Setup:**
- Supermarket at receiving or point-of-use
- Kanban for each raw material SKU
- Min/max levels marked

**Operation:**
1. Production consumes raw material
2. Kanban removed when reaching min level
3. Kanban goes to purchasing/receiving
4. Triggers reorder or delivery from supplier
5. Material delivered, replenishes supermarket
6. Kanban returns to supermarket

**Benefits:**
- Right-sized raw material inventory
- No excess "just in case" stock
- Automatic reordering

### Supplier Integration

**Kanban with Suppliers:**

**Option 1: Kanban-Triggered Orders**
- Send Kanban to supplier (fax, email, EDI)
- Supplier delivers one Kanban quantity
- Frequent small deliveries

**Option 2: Supplier-Managed Inventory**
- Supplier owns inventory on your floor
- Supplier monitors levels
- Replenishes as needed
- You pay as consumed

**Option 3: Milk Runs**
- Regular supplier pickup route
- Collects Kanbans, delivers parts
- Daily or multiple times per day
- Mixed loads from multiple suppliers

**Requirements:**

**Supplier Partnership:**
- Trust and commitment
- Quality at source (no incoming inspection)
- Reliable delivery
- Proximity helps (but not required)

**Stable Demand:**
- Predictable consumption
- Level scheduling (heijunka)
- Advance visibility to changes

**Flexible Delivery:**
- Small quantities
- Frequent deliveries
- Standard containers

### Example: CNC Shop Raw Materials

**Aluminum Bar Stock:**
- Consumption: 10 bars/week
- Lead time: 1 week
- Safety stock: 20%
- **Kanban quantity: (10 × 1) × 1.2 = 12 bars**
- **2 Kanbans (minimum) = 24 bars max inventory**

**Before Kanban:**
- Ordered monthly: 40 bars
- "Just in case" buffer: 10 bars
- **Total: 50 bars inventory**
- **Carrying cost: 50 bars × $100 × 25% = $1,250/year**

**After Kanban:**
- Weekly deliveries: 12 bars
- **Max: 24 bars inventory**
- **Carrying cost: 24 bars × $100 × 25% = $600/year**
- **Savings: $650/year per SKU**

- Bins at point-of-use (not central crib)
- Empty bin triggers reorder

**Example: Cutting Inserts**
- Consumption: 20 inserts/week
- Lead time: 1 week (internal stock or supplier)
- Bin size: 25 inserts
- **Two bins per machine = 50 inserts max**

**Benefits:**
- Tools at point-of-use (no walking to crib)
- Automatic replenishment
- Reduced inventory
- No stockouts

### Consumables Kanban

**Examples:**
- Coolant
- Shop rags
- Abrasives

## 24.5.9 Kanban Rules and Discipline

**Kanban only works with discipline.** Breaking rules breaks the system.

### The Six Rules of Kanban (Toyota)

**Rule 1: Never Pass Defective Products**
- Downstream process inspects
- Rejects defects immediately
- Stops flow, signals problem
- Root cause addressed

**Rule 2: Downstream Process Withdraws Only What's Needed**
- Pull, not push
- Take only Kanban quantity
- At specified time/frequency
- No "borrowing" ahead

**Rule 3: Produce Only Exact Quantity Withdrawn**
- No overproduction
- One Kanban = one container
- No producing "extra just in case"

**Rule 4: Level the Production (Heijunka)**
- Smooth demand variation
- Small batches frequently
- Avoid lumpy schedules
- Enables small Kanban quantities

**Rule 5: Kanban is a Fine-Tuning Tool**
- Small adjustments to demand
- Not for large changes or new products
- Gradual reduction of Kanban quantity
- Continuous improvement tool

**Rule 6: Stabilize and Rationalize the Process**
- Reliable equipment (TPM)
- Standard work
- Quality at source
- **Foundation before Kanban**

### Common Discipline Failures

**"Borrowing" from Next Kanban:**
- "We're almost out, I'll just take from the next bin"
- **Breaks the signal**
- Hides true demand
- Causes shortages

**Overproducing:**
- "I have time, I'll make extras"
- Defeats Kanban purpose
- Creates excess inventory
- No authorization

**Ignoring Signals:**
- Cards pile up, not acted on
- "I'll get to it later"
- Breaks pull system
- Stockouts result

**Not Following Min/Max:**
- Overfilling supermarkets
- "More is safer"
- Defeats inventory control

**Bypassing System:**
- Emergency orders outside Kanban
- "Just this once"
- Becomes habitual
- System credibility lost

### Enforcing Discipline

**Visual Management:**
- Kanban status boards
- Red flags for violations
- Public metrics

**Leadership:**
- Follow rules consistently
- No exceptions
- Gemba walks to verify
- Address violations immediately

**Training:**
- Everyone understands why rules matter
- Consequences of breaking rules
- System logic

**Continuous Improvement:**
- Problems exposed by Kanban
- Solve root causes
- Make system easier to follow

---

## Summary

Kanban is a visual pull system that controls inventory and production through signals. Production Kanbans authorize manufacturing, withdrawal Kanbans authorize movement, and supplier Kanbans trigger deliveries. The number of Kanbans is calculated based on demand, lead time, and safety stock. Simple two-bin systems work well for small consumables, while electronic Kanban scales for complex operations.

Kanban requires discipline: produce only to Kanban authorization, never pass defects, withdraw only what's needed. When rules are followed, Kanban prevents overproduction, limits WIP, and creates self-regulating flow. Continuous improvement reduces Kanban quantities over time, exposing and eliminating waste.
