## 11. Welding Strategy & Thermal Management: Achieving Precision Through Controlled Fabrication

### 11.1 The Welding Paradox in Precision Machine Construction

Professional CNC machine frames require **precision geometry** (flatness, straightness, parallelism to ±0.02–0.05 mm) yet are constructed primarily through **welding**—a process that introduces:

- **Localized heating** to 1,400–2,500°C (melting temperature of steel)
- **Rapid thermal expansion** followed by contraction during cooling
- **Residual stresses** reaching 50–90% of material yield strength
- **Geometric distortion** ranging from 0.5–5.0 mm depending on joint design and procedure

The fundamental challenge: *How do we achieve precision from an imprecise process?*

The answer lies in understanding welding-induced distortion mechanisms, applying strategic sequencing and fixturing, and using post-weld correction techniques. This section provides the engineering framework for precision welding in machine tool fabrication.

### 11.2 Welding-Induced Distortion: Physical Mechanisms

#### **11.2.1 The Thermal Cycle and Material Response**

During welding, material adjacent to the weld experiences a complete thermal cycle:

**Phase 1: Heating (0–3 seconds)**
- Weld pool reaches 1,500°C (for steel GMAW)
- Material within ~10–20 mm of weld heats to 800–1,200°C
- Thermal expansion occurs: $\Delta L = \alpha L \Delta T$
- Surrounding cold material constrains expansion → **compressive stress** in heated zone

**Phase 2: Solidification (1–2 seconds)**
- Weld pool solidifies (1,500°C → 800°C)
- Shrinkage begins, but material still hot and weak
- Plastic deformation occurs if stress exceeds yield (temperature-dependent)

**Phase 3: Cooling (10–300 seconds)**
- Material cools to ambient temperature
- Contraction: $\Delta L = -\alpha L \Delta T$
- Surrounding material now resists contraction → **tensile stress** in weld zone
- Residual stress pattern: tension in weld, compression in surrounding material

**Result**: Permanent dimensional change (distortion) and locked-in stress (residual stress).

#### **11.2.2 Types of Welding Distortion**

**1. Longitudinal Shrinkage**

Weld contracts along its length, shortening the welded member:

$$\Delta L_{long} \approx k \frac{A_{weld} L}{A_{section}}$$

where:
- $k \approx 0.001$–0.0015 (empirical constant for steel GMAW)
- $A_{weld}$ = cross-sectional area of weld deposit (mm²)
- $L$ = weld length (mm)
- $A_{section}$ = cross-sectional area of base material (mm²)

**Practical Example:**

For a 2,500 mm long tube (100×100×5 mm wall) with single-pass fillet weld (6 mm leg):
- $A_{weld} \approx 0.5 \times 6 \times 6 = 18$ mm²
- $A_{section} = 4 \times (100 \times 5) - 4 \times 5^2 = 1,900$ mm²
- $k = 0.0012$

$$\Delta L = 0.0012 \times \frac{18 \times 2,500}{1,900} = 0.0284 \text{ mm}$$

This 0.028 mm shrinkage is small but accumulates across multiple welds. For a frame with 20 longitudinal welds, total shrinkage could reach 0.5–0.6 mm.

**2. Transverse Shrinkage**

Weld contracts perpendicular to weld line, pulling adjacent plates together:

$$\Delta W_{trans} = C \times \frac{A_{weld}}{t}$$

where:
- $C \approx 0.05$–0.10 (constant depending on joint restraint)
- $t$ = plate thickness (mm)

For butt joint, 10 mm plate, 8 mm weld cross-section:

$$\Delta W = 0.07 \times \frac{8}{10} = 0.056 \text{ mm per side}$$

**3. Angular Distortion**

Non-symmetric welds (e.g., single-side fillet, single-V groove) create **moment** causing rotation:

$$\theta \approx \frac{C \cdot A_{weld}}{I / y}$$

where:
- $I$ = moment of inertia of section about neutral axis
- $y$ = distance from neutral axis to weld centroid
- $C \approx 0.002$–0.004 rad·mm²/mm⁴ (empirical)

**Simplified form for fillet weld on beam**:

$$\theta \approx \frac{3 \Delta L_{long}}{2 h}$$

where $h$ = beam height.

**Example**: 200 mm tall beam, longitudinal shrinkage 0.10 mm:

$$\theta = \frac{3 \times 0.10}{2 \times 200} = 0.00075 \text{ rad} = 0.043° = 2.6 \text{ arcmin}$$

Over 2,000 mm length, this angular error translates to:

$$\delta = L \tan(\theta) \approx 2,000 \times 0.00075 = 1.5 \text{ mm vertical deviation}$$

**Unacceptable** for precision machine—requires mitigation.

**4. Buckling Distortion**

Thin panels (t < 6 mm) under compressive residual stress can buckle out-of-plane:

$$F_{critical} = \frac{\pi^2 E I}{L^2}$$

If compressive stress $\sigma_{residual} \times A > F_{critical}$, panel buckles (oil-canning).

**Prevention**: Weld thick sections first, provide intermediate tack welds, use stitch welding (discussed below).

### 11.3 Heat Input and Its Control

Heat input per unit length of weld directly determines distortion magnitude:

$$Q = \frac{V \times I \times 60}{\text{Travel Speed (mm/min)}} \times \eta$$

where:
- $V$ = arc voltage (V)
- $I$ = welding current (A)
- $\eta$ = process efficiency: 0.75 (GMAW), 0.85 (FCAW), 0.95 (GTAW)

**Unit**: kJ/mm or J/mm

**Example**: GMAW welding at 22V, 180A, travel speed 300 mm/min:

$$Q = \frac{22 \times 180 \times 60}{300} \times 0.75 = \frac{237,600}{300} \times 0.75 = 594 \text{ J/mm}$$

**Heat Input Guidelines for Structural Steel**:

| Material Thickness | Recommended Heat Input | Process | Notes |
|--------------------|----------------------|---------|-------|
| 3–5 mm | 300–600 J/mm | GMAW short-circuit | Low heat, fast travel, minimize distortion |
| 5–10 mm | 600–1,200 J/mm | GMAW spray transfer | Balanced penetration and distortion |
| 10–20 mm | 1,000–2,000 J/mm | FCAW or GMAW | May require preheat for thick sections |
| >20 mm | 1,500–3,000 J/mm | FCAW, multi-pass | Preheat 100–200°C, post-weld stress relief |

**Strategy**: Use minimum heat input that achieves adequate penetration and fusion. Lower heat input → less distortion, but risk of incomplete fusion.

### 11.4 Stitch-Welding Strategy: Balancing Strength and Distortion

**Continuous welding** (uninterrupted bead along full length) maximizes joint strength but causes maximum cumulative distortion. **Stitch welding** (intermittent weld segments) reduces distortion at the cost of slightly reduced strength.

#### **11.4.1 Stitch Weld Design Parameters**

$$\text{Weld Pattern: } L_{weld} \text{ mm ON, } L_{gap} \text{ mm OFF}$$

**Effective Weld Percentage**:

$$\text{Weld \%} = \frac{L_{weld}}{L_{weld} + L_{gap}} \times 100\%$$

**Design Guidelines**:

| Application | Weld % | Typical Pattern | Strength vs. Continuous | Distortion vs. Continuous |
|-------------|--------|----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Non-structural skin | 20–30% | 25 mm ON / 75 mm OFF | 30–40% | 20–30% |
| Moderate load | 40–60% | 50 mm ON / 50 mm OFF | 60–75% | 40–60% |
| High load, precision | 60–80% | 75 mm ON / 25 mm OFF | 80–90% | 60–80% |
| Precision datum mounting | 50–60% | **Edge-stitch** (see below) | 70–80% | 40–50% |

#### **11.4.2 Edge-Stitch Welding for Flatbar Mounting**

The epoxy-bedded flatbar system (Section 9) uses **edge-stitch welding**: short welds along the flatbar edges, alternating sides, with controlled spacing to minimize cumulative distortion.

**Specification** (from Section 9):
- Weld length: 25 mm
- Weld spacing: 200 mm (center-to-center)
- Pattern: Alternating sides (left-right-left-right)
- Weld %: $\frac{25}{200} \times 100\% = 12.5\%$ per side

**Distortion Analysis**:

Total shrinkage for continuous weld, 2,500 mm length:

$$\Delta L_{continuous} = 0.0012 \times \frac{18 \times 2,500}{1,900} = 0.028 \text{ mm}$$

With 12.5% stitch pattern:

$$\Delta L_{stitch} = 0.028 \times 0.125 = 0.0035 \text{ mm}$$

**Result**: 8× reduction in longitudinal shrinkage while maintaining adequate mechanical attachment (epoxy carries primary load).

### 11.5 Welding Sequence: Order Matters

The sequence in which welds are executed dramatically affects final distortion. **Principle**: Welds executed later pull against welds executed earlier, creating complex stress patterns.

#### **11.5.1 Symmetric Welding (Back-Step Method)**

For symmetric structures (e.g., rectangular frame), weld:

**Optimal Sequence**:
1. Tack-weld all corners (4–6 tacks per corner, 25 mm long)
2. Weld short sides first (minimizes initial distortion)
3. Weld long sides using **back-step technique**:
   - Divide weld into segments (300–500 mm each)
   - Weld each segment backward (right-to-left if general direction is left-to-right)
   - This creates local compressive stress that opposes global tension

**Example**: 2,500 mm long side rail, divided into 5 segments of 500 mm:
- Segment order: 3 → 1 → 4 → 2 → 5 (alternate ends)
- Within each segment: Weld backward (travel right-to-left for segment starting at left)

**Effect**: Residual stress pattern becomes more uniform, reducing bow and twist by 40–60% compared to continuous one-direction welding.

#### **11.5.2 Alternating-Side Welding for Angular Distortion Control**

For T-joints and fillet welds, alternate sides to balance angular distortion:

**Poor Practice**: Weld all left-side fillets, then all right-side fillets
- Result: Cumulative angular distortion, beam bows toward first-welded side

**Best Practice**: Alternate left-right-left-right every 300–500 mm
- Result: Angular distortions partially cancel, net distortion 50–70% lower

### 11.6 Fixturing and Restraint Strategies

External mechanical restraint during welding can:
- **Reduce distortion** by preventing free contraction
- **Increase residual stress** because material cannot relieve stress through deformation
- **Create locked-in stress** that releases upon fixture removal, causing springback

#### **11.6.1 Rigid Fixturing**

Clamp assembly to heavy steel fixture table with toe clamps every 300–500 mm.

**Advantages**:
- Maintains dimensional accuracy during welding
- Reduces in-process distortion

**Disadvantages**:
- High residual stress (70–90% yield strength typical)
- Springback upon release (30–50% of prevented distortion)
- Risk of cracking if restraint is excessive

**Application**: Use for final-dimension assemblies where post-weld machining is not planned.

#### **11.6.2 Compliant Fixturing**

Support assembly on adjustable jack screws or spring-loaded clamps that allow controlled movement.

**Advantages**:
- Lower residual stress (material can partially relieve stress)
- Less springback
- Easier setup

**Disadvantages**:
- Some in-process distortion occurs
- Requires post-weld straightening or machining

**Application**: Use for intermediate assemblies that will undergo subsequent processing.

#### **11.6.3 Pre-Bending (Distortion Compensation)**

Intentionally prebend or preset structure in opposite direction to anticipated distortion, such that welding distortion brings it back to desired geometry.

**Example**: Frame rail expected to bow upward 2.0 mm at center due to welding.
- Prebend downward 2.5 mm using hydraulic press
- Weld per normal procedure
- After welding, residual upward bow brings rail to within 0.5 mm of flat

**Requires**:
- Accurate distortion prediction (FEA or empirical testing)
- Sophisticated fixturing
- Experience with specific joint designs

### 11.7 Post-Weld Stress Relief and Straightening

#### **11.7.1 Thermal Stress Relief**

Heat entire structure to 550–650°C (for steel), hold 1–2 hours, slow-cool in furnace.

**Mechanism**: At elevated temperature, material yield strength drops, allowing residual stresses to relax through creep.

**Stress Reduction**: 80–95% of initial residual stress

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires large furnace (expensive for 2+ meter frames)
- Scaling and oxidation (requires post-heat cleaning)
- Dimensional changes during cooling (typically 0.05–0.15 mm over 2 m)

**Application**: High-precision or high-load structures where residual stress could cause fatigue failure or long-term dimensional instability.

#### **11.7.2 Vibratory Stress Relief (VSR)**

Apply cyclic mechanical vibration at sub-resonant frequency (10–50 Hz) with slowly increasing amplitude until peak stress approaches yield.

**Mechanism**: Localized plastic flow at stress concentrations relieves peak stresses.

**Stress Reduction**: 30–60% (less than thermal, but sufficient for many applications)

**Advantages**:
- Portable equipment, can treat structure in-place
- No thermal distortion
- Fast (10–30 minutes treatment time)

**Disadvantages**:
- Less effective than thermal stress relief
- Requires skilled operator to avoid over-treatment

**Application**: Large structures where thermal stress relief is impractical; medium-precision requirements.

#### **11.7.3 Mechanical Straightening**

Use hydraulic press or flame heating to physically straighten distorted members.

**Press Straightening**:
- Measure bow/twist with precision level or laser
- Calculate required corrective force: $F = \frac{48 E I \delta}{L^3}$
- Apply force gradually, monitor with dial indicators
- Overshoot by 20–30% to account for springback

**Example**: 2,000 mm beam with 3.0 mm upward bow, $I = 2 \times 10^7$ mm⁴, steel:

$$F = \frac{48 \times 200,000 \times 2 \times 10^7 \times 3.0}{2,000^3} = \frac{5.76 \times 10^{14}}{8 \times 10^{9}} = 72,000 \text{ N} = 7.2 \text{ tonnes}$$

**Flame Straightening**:
- Heat localized area (50–100 mm diameter spot) to 600–800°C with oxy-acetylene torch
- Material expands then contracts upon cooling, inducing corrective stress
- Requires significant skill; risk of over-correction or cracking

### 11.8 Weld Quality and Inspection

Precision machines require not just dimensionally accurate welds but also structurally sound welds free of defects.

#### **11.8.1 Common Weld Defects**

| Defect | Description | Cause | Detection Method | Severity |
|--------|-------------|-------|------------------|----------|
| **Porosity** | Gas bubbles trapped in weld metal | Contaminated wire, insufficient shielding gas | Visual, X-ray | Moderate (reduces strength 10–30%) |
| **Incomplete Fusion** | Weld metal doesn't fully fuse to base metal | Insufficient heat, poor joint prep | Ultrasonic, destructive testing | Critical (stress riser, crack initiation) |
| **Undercut** | Groove melted into base metal at weld toe | Excessive current, wrong angle | Visual, profile gauge | Moderate to Critical (stress concentration) |
| **Cracking** | Cracks in weld or heat-affected zone (HAZ) | High restraint, hydrogen, rapid cooling | Dye penetrant, magnetic particle | Critical (immediate failure risk) |
| **Distortion** | Deviation from dimensional tolerance | Excessive heat input, poor sequence | Precision measurement | Moderate (repairable) |

#### **11.8.2 Inspection Protocol for Machine Frames**

**Level 1: Visual Inspection (100% of welds)**
- Verify: Complete fusion, uniform bead appearance, no visible cracks or porosity
- Tools: Magnifying glass, weld gauge
- Acceptance: Per AWS D1.1 structural welding code

**Level 2: Dimensional Verification (100% of critical dimensions)**
- Measure: Straightness, flatness, squareness using precision level, laser, CMM
- Acceptance: Within design tolerances (±0.05 mm typical)

**Level 3: Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) (10–20% sampling or critical welds)**
- Methods: Dye penetrant (surface cracks), ultrasonic (internal defects), X-ray (porosity)
- Acceptance: Per AWS D1.1 or machine-specific criteria

**Level 4: Proof Loading (post-assembly)**
- Apply 150% of maximum operational load
- Monitor deflection with dial indicators
- Acceptance: No permanent deformation, deflection within predictions ±20%

### 11.9 Welding Process Selection for Machine Frames

| Process | Advantages | Disadvantages | Typical Application |
|---------|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| **GMAW (MIG)** | Fast, versatile, low skill requirement, low spatter | Moderate heat input, outdoor wind sensitivity | General frame construction, tubes and plates |
| **FCAW** | High deposition rate, good penetration, self-shielding variants | Higher heat input, more spatter, slag removal | Heavy sections (>10 mm), high-productivity |
| **GTAW (TIG)** | Excellent control, low heat input, highest quality | Slow, high skill requirement, expensive | Precision joints, thin materials (<5 mm), critical welds |
| **SMAW (Stick)** | Simple equipment, outdoor capability, no shielding gas | Slow, slag removal, moderate quality | Field repairs, heavy sections, low-precision |

**Recommendation for CNC machine frames**:
- **Primary process**: GMAW (MIG) for 90% of joints (speed and quality balance)
- **Precision joints**: GTAW (TIG) for flatbar edge-stitching and critical datum welds
- **Heavy sections**: FCAW for base frame tubes >12 mm wall thickness

### 11.10 Material Considerations and Weldability

#### **11.10.1 Structural Steel Grades**

**A36 / A500 (Mild Steel)**:
- Carbon: 0.25–0.29% (low)
- **Excellent weldability**, no preheat required for t <25 mm
- Preferred for general frame construction
- Filler: ER70S-6 (GMAW), E7018 (SMAW)

**1018 Cold-Rolled Steel (Flatbars)**:
- Carbon: 0.15–0.20% (very low)
- Excellent weldability
- **Caution**: Edge-stitch only (full-length welds distort precision flatness)

**4140 Alloy Steel (High-Strength Applications)**:
- Carbon: 0.40%, Cr-Mo alloy
- **Moderate weldability**, requires preheat 200–300°C for t >10 mm
- Risk of HAZ cracking if cooling is too rapid
- Filler: ER80S-D2, post-weld stress relief mandatory

#### **11.10.2 Aluminum Alloys**

**6061-T6 (Gantry Beams)**:
- **Good weldability** with GMAW (ER4043 or ER5356 filler)
- T6 temper lost in HAZ (strength drops 50% within 25 mm of weld)
- Post-weld heat treatment not practical for large assemblies
- **Design strategy**: Avoid welding in high-stress regions; use bolted connections

**7075-T6 (High-Strength)**:
- **Poor weldability**, prone to hot cracking
- Not recommended for welded construction
- Use 6061-T6 instead or design for bolted assembly

### 11.11 Practical Welding Procedure: Frame Base Assembly

**Example**: Constructing 2,500 mm × 1,500 mm base frame from 127×127×4.8 mm steel tubes

**Step 1: Material Preparation**
- Cut tubes to length ±0.5 mm using cold saw (not abrasive cutoff—heat-affected edges)
- Deburr edges with file or grinder
- Clean joint areas with acetone (remove oil, rust, paint)

**Step 2: Tack Welding**
- Assemble frame on flat welding table (flatness <0.5 mm/m)
- Check squareness: Measure diagonals (must be equal within 1.0 mm)
- Tack-weld corners: 4 tacks per corner, 25 mm long, at 90° intervals
- Re-check squareness after tacking (thermal distortion may shift)

**Step 3: Full Welding (GMAW, ER70S-6 wire, 75% Ar / 25% CO₂ shielding gas)**
- Settings: 22V, 180A, 300 mm/min travel speed
- Weld sequence:
  1. Short sides first (1,500 mm rails)
  2. Long sides (2,500 mm rails) using back-step method
  3. Alternate top-bottom fillets every 500 mm
- Interpass temperature: Keep below 200°C (use IR thermometer; pause to cool if needed)

**Step 4: Cross-Member Installation**
- Install six cross-members at 380 mm spacing
- Tack first, verify parallelism (bridge gauge)
- Full-weld using stitch pattern: 50 mm ON / 100 mm OFF

**Step 5: Post-Weld Inspection**
- Allow 4+ hours for complete cool-down to ambient
- Measure flatness with precision level (target: <0.05 mm/m)
- Measure parallelism of long rails (target: <0.03 mm over 2,500 mm)
- If out-of-tolerance: Apply corrective straightening (press or flame)

**Step 6: Flatbar Mounting Surfaces**
- Machine or grind top surface of long rails flat (±0.01 mm, Section 9)
- Install epoxy-bedded flatbars per Section 9 procedure
- Edge-stitch weld flatbars: 25 mm welds at 200 mm spacing, alternating sides

**Expected Results**:
- Flatness: 0.03–0.08 mm/m (achievable without post-weld machining)
- Straightness: 0.02–0.06 mm/m
- Squareness: <0.05 mm difference in diagonals
- Residual stress: 150–300 MPa (vs. 400+ MPa for uncontrolled welding)

### 11.12 Thermal Management: Operational Considerations

Beyond welding-induced thermal effects, operating machines experience thermal loads from:

**1. Motor Heat (20–30% of electrical input becomes heat)**
- 750W Y-axis motor: ~150W heat dissipated
- Operating 8 hours: 4.32 MJ thermal energy
- Frame thermal mass: ~800 kg steel = 3.6 MJ/°C
- Temperature rise: ~1.2°C (if uniformly distributed—reality: local heating 5–10°C)

**2. Ambient Temperature Cycling**
- Daily shop temperature swing: 10–15°C typical
- Seasonal: 20–30°C in non-climate-controlled facilities
- Solar loading through windows: 15–25°C local increase on illuminated surfaces

**3. Process Heat**
- Plasma torch: 500W+ radiated heat (localized, intermittent)
- Spindle motor: 200W heat (continuous during cutting)

**Mitigation Strategies** (detailed in Section 1.3.2):
- Thermal coupling to floor (steel grout pads, large footprint)
- Symmetric motor placement (heat cancels geometrically)
- Warm-up protocol (10-minute rapid traverse before precision work)
- Temperature compensation (software-based, requires calibration)
