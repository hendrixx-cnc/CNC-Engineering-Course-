# Module 24 – L.E.A.N. Strategies for CNC Manufacturing


## 24.4.1 JIT Principles and Philosophy

**Just-In-Time (JIT)** is a production strategy that strives to produce the right part, in the right quantity, at the right time.

### Core Principle

**"Nothing is produced until it is needed."**

### The Three Elements of JIT

**1. Just-In-Time Delivery:**
- Parts arrive exactly when needed
- No early (creates inventory)
- No late (creates shortages)
- Frequent small deliveries vs. large batches

**2. Just-In-Time Production:**
- Make only what's needed
- Match customer demand rate (takt time)
- Eliminate overproduction waste

**3. Just-In-Time Information:**
- Information flows at right time
- Pull signals trigger production
- Real-time visibility

### JIT vs. "Just-In-Case"

**Traditional "Just-In-Case" Thinking:**
- Build inventory buffers everywhere
- "Better safe than sorry"
- Protect against problems
- Result: High inventory, slow response, hidden problems

**JIT Thinking:**
- Minimal inventory
- Expose problems
- Fix root causes
- Result: Low inventory, fast response, continuous improvement

**Analogy: Water and Rocks**
- Inventory = water level in river
- Problems = rocks hidden underwater
- **Just-In-Case:** Raise water level (hide rocks)
- **JIT:** Lower water level (expose rocks), remove rocks

### JIT Requirements

**For JIT to work, you need:**

**1. Stable, Capable Processes:**
- High equipment uptime
- Consistent quality
- Low variation
- TPM (Total Productive Maintenance)

**2. Quick Changeovers:**
- Short setup times
- Small batch flexibility
- SMED (Single Minute Exchange of Dies)

**3. Balanced Operations:**
- Smooth flow
- Minimal bottlenecks
- Takt time alignment

**4. Visual Management:**
- Pull signals
- Kanban cards
- Andons

**5. Supplier Partnerships:**
- Reliable deliveries
- Quality at source
- Frequent small shipments

**6. Quality at Source:**
- Build quality in
- Immediate problem solving
- Poka-yoke (error proofing)

## 24.4.2 Takt Time

**Takt** is German for "beat" or "pulse" (like a metronome marking musical time).

**Takt Time** is the rate at which customers demand products.

### 24.4.2.1 Calculating Takt Time

**Formula:**

**Takt Time = Available Production Time ÷ Customer Demand**

**Example 1: CNC Machine Shop**

**Given:**
- Customer demand: 400 parts per day
- Shift: 8 hours (480 minutes)
- Breaks: 2 × 15 min = 30 minutes
- Available time: 480 - 30 = 450 minutes/day

**Takt Time Calculation:**
- Takt = 450 min ÷ 400 parts
- **Takt = 1.125 minutes per part**
- **= 67.5 seconds per part**

**Interpretation:** Need to complete one part every 67.5 seconds to meet customer demand.

**Example 2: Variable Demand**

**Monthly demand:**
- Week 1: 100 parts
- Week 2: 120 parts
- Week 3: 110 parts  
- Week 4: 90 parts
- **Average: 105 parts/week**

**Takt Time (based on average):**
- Available time: 5 days × 450 min = 2,250 min/week
- Takt = 2,250 ÷ 105 = **21.4 minutes per part**

### 24.4.2.2 Balancing to Takt

**Goal:** Adjust process capacity to match takt time.

**Process Cycle Time vs. Takt Time:**

**If Cycle Time < Takt Time:**
- Process capacity exceeds demand
- Potential overproduction
- **Solution:** Slow down, redeploy operator time, reduce staffing

**If Cycle Time > Takt Time:**
- Process can't meet demand
- Bottleneck
- **Solution:** Add capacity, reduce cycle time, add shifts/overtime

**If Cycle Time ≈ Takt Time:**
- Balanced
- Match demand perfectly
- **Ideal state**

**Example: Balancing a Cell**

**Takt Time: 60 seconds**

| Operation | Current C/T | Status | Action |
|-----------|------------|--------|--------|
| Load part | 15 sec | OK | None |
| Machine op 1 | 45 sec | OK | None |
| Machine op 2 | 75 sec | **Over takt!** | Reduce C/T or add capacity |
| Inspect | 20 sec | OK | None |
| Unload | 10 sec | OK | None |

**Operation 2 is bottleneck** (75 sec > 60 sec takt).

**Options:**
1. Reduce cycle time (better tooling, feeds/speeds)
2. Offload some work to another operation
3. Add second machine for operation 2
4. Run operation 2 on overtime/extra shift

### 24.4.2.3 Takt Time in Job Shop Environments

**Challenge:** Job shops have high mix, variable demand per product.

**Approaches:**

**1. Family Takt Time:**
- Calculate takt for product family
- Balance cell to family average
- Mix products within family

**Example:**
- Product A: 50/week
- Product B: 30/week
- Product C: 20/week
- **Family demand: 100/week**
- Takt = 2,250 min ÷ 100 = **22.5 min**

**2. Adjust Staffing:**
- Flexible labor
- Cross-trained operators
- Add/remove operators as demand changes

**3. Running Takt:**
- Calculate takt based on current orders
- Re-evaluate weekly or monthly
- Adapt capacity

**4. Focus on Cycle Time Reduction:**
- Even with variable takt, reducing cycle time helps
- Increases flexibility
- Enables faster response

## 24.4.3 Continuous Flow Manufacturing

**Continuous Flow:** Products move through operations without interruption, one piece at a time.

### 24.4.3.1 One-Piece Flow

**Definition:** Each part completes all operations before the next part starts.

**Contrast with Batch:**

**Batch Processing:**
```
Operation 1: Make 100 pieces (100 min)
↓ [Wait: 1 day]
Operation 2: Process 100 pieces (150 min)
↓ [Wait: 1 day]
Operation 3: Finish 100 pieces (80 min)

Lead time: ~2 days
```

**One-Piece Flow:**
```
Part 1: Op1 (1 min) → Op2 (1.5 min) → Op3 (0.8 min)
Part 2: Op1 (1 min) → Op2 (1.5 min) → Op3 (0.8 min)
...

Lead time per part: 3.3 minutes
```

**Benefits of One-Piece Flow:**

**1. Shortest Lead Time:**
- Part 1 complete in 3.3 minutes (not 2 days!)
- Customer sees fast delivery

**2. Minimal WIP:**
- Only parts currently being processed
- No batches waiting
- Reduced inventory cost

**3. Immediate Quality Feedback:**
- Defect discovered at next operation (seconds away)
- Not days later
- Small impact (one part, not batch of 100)

**4. Flexible:**
- Can switch products easily
- No large batches to complete first

**5. Less Space:**
- No WIP storage areas
- Compact cell layout

**6. Simpler Scheduling:**
- No complex batch sequencing
- Just release parts at takt time

### 24.4.3.2 Cell Design for Flow

**Manufacturing Cell:** Group of operations arranged in process sequence for one-piece flow.

**U-Shaped Cell (Most Common):**

```
    Inlet ↓             ↑ Outlet
         ┌───────────┐
         │           │
    Op1  │           │  Op5
         │           │
    Op2  │   Work    │  Op4
         │   Area    │
    Op3  └───────────┘
         
    Operator walks inside U
    Tends multiple machines
    Inlet/Outlet close together
```

**Cell Design Principles:**

**1. Sequence by Process:**
- Operations in production sequence
- Minimize backtracking
- Logical flow

**2. Compact Layout:**
- Machines close together
- Walking minimized
- Hand-off between operations

**3. U-Shape Benefits:**
- Operator in center
- Can see all machines
- Inlet/outlet close (easy communication)
- Compact footprint

**4. Multi-Process Handling:**
- One operator runs multiple machines
- Walk loop through cell
- Tends machine while previous operation runs

**5. Built-In Quality:**
- Inspection integrated
- Immediate feedback
- Defects don't propagate

### 24.4.3.3 Flow in CNC Operations

**Challenge:** CNC machines have long cycle times.

**Strategies:**

**1. Multi-Machine Cells:**
- Operator tends 3-5 CNC machines
- While one runs, operator loads/unloads others
- Walking path through cell

**Example:**
- Takt time: 5 minutes
- CNC cycle time: 15 minutes each
- **Solution:** 3 CNCs in cell, 1 operator
  - Load machine 1, start cycle
  - Load machine 2, start cycle
  - Load machine 3, start cycle
  - Unload machine 1 (cycle complete), reload
  - Continuous loop

**2. Mixed Manual/Automated:**
- CNC for long operations
- Manual for quick operations
- Operator does manual work while CNC runs

**3. Right-Size Equipment:**
- Smaller machines (faster cycle)
- Multiple smaller vs. one large
- Dedicated to cell, not shared

**4. Quick Changeover (SMED):**
- Enable small batches
- Mix products in cell
- Flexibility

**5. Standardize Work:**
- Consistent method
- Predictable timing
- Smooth flow

## 24.4.4 Pull Systems

**Pull Production:** Downstream customer signals upstream to produce.

**Contrast with Push:**

**Push System:**
- Forecast demand
- Schedule each operation independently
- Push work through
- Result: Overproduction, excess WIP

**Pull System:**
- Actual consumption triggers production
- Produce only to replace what was used
- Signal upstream (Kanban)
- Result: Right-sized inventory, no overproduction

### 24.4.4.1 Pull vs. Push Production

**Push Example (Traditional MRP):**
```
Forecast: 1000 parts needed next month

MRP Schedule:
- Release 1000 blanks to Lathe
- Release 1000 to Mill (after lathe)
- Release 1000 to Assembly

Reality:
- Demand changes to 800
- WIP: 200 extra parts throughout system
```

**Pull Example (Kanban):**
```
Customer takes 100 parts from supermarket
↓ [Empty Kanban signals]
Assembly produces 100 to refill
↓ [Assembly Kanban signals]
Mill produces 100 to refill assembly
↓ [Mill Kanban signals]
Lathe produces 100 to refill mill

Result: Only 100 produced (what was consumed)
```

**Pull Benefits:**
- Produce exactly what's needed
- Self-regulating (demand changes automatically adjust production)
- Minimal inventory
- Simple visual signals

### 24.4.4.2 Supermarket Systems

**Supermarket:** Controlled inventory location with specific quantity of each item.

**Like a Grocery Store:**
- Each product has shelf location
- Quantity limits (min/max)
- When customer takes item, store restocks
- Visual signals

**Manufacturing Supermarket:**
- Finished goods or WIP storage
- Each SKU has defined location
- Visual min/max levels
- Pull replenishment when stock taken

**Design:**
- Flow racks or shelving
- FIFO (first-in-first-out)
- Clear labels
- Color-coded
- Kanban cards

**Sizing:**
- Buffer for demand variation
- Lead time to replenish
- Not excess "just in case"

**Example:**

**Hardware Supermarket:**
- Bolts, nuts, screws for assembly
- Each SKU in labeled bin
- Min/max marked visually
- When quantity reaches min, Kanban triggers reorder
- Supplier delivers to supermarket

### 24.4.4.3 Kanban Cards and Signals

**Kanban:** Japanese for "signal" or "card."

**Kanban Card:**
- Authorization to produce or move
- Contains: Part number, quantity, location
- Attached to container

**How It Works:**

**Production Kanban:**
1. Downstream customer takes parts from supermarket
2. Production Kanban card removed
3. Card goes to upstream process
4. Card authorizes production of one container quantity
5. Parts produced, card attached to container
6. Container delivered to supermarket
7. Cycle repeats

**Withdrawal Kanban:**
- Authorization to move parts
- Material handler sees card
- Moves container from upstream to downstream

**Signal Kanban:**
- Batch production situations
- Accumulate cards until batch size reached
- Produce batch to replenish

**Visual Signals (Alternative to Cards):**
- **Two-bin system:** Empty bin signals reorder
- **Andon lights:** Light color indicates status
- **Floor markings:** Empty space = produce to fill
- **Ball/flag:** Physical signal at machine

*Detailed Kanban covered in Section 24.5*

## 24.4.5 Leveling Production (Heijunka)

**Heijunka:** Japanese for "leveling" or "smoothing."

**Goal:** Produce products in small batches at a steady, predictable rate.

### 24.4.5.1 Production Smoothing

**Problem: Lumpy Demand**

**Customer orders (monthly):**
- Week 1: 200 Product A
- Week 2: 0
- Week 3: 150 Product A
- Week 4: 50 Product A

**Traditional Response (Chase Demand):**
- Week 1: Build 200 A (surge capacity, overtime)
- Week 2: Idle or build other products
- Week 3: Build 150 A
- Week 4: Build 50 A

**Problems:**
- Variable workload (overload then underload)
- Overtime costs
- Quality suffers (rushing)
- Supplier whipsaw effect

**Heijunka Approach (Level):**
- Average demand: 400/month = 100/week
- **Build 100 per week every week**
- Smooth, predictable

**Benefits:**
- Stable workforce (no overtime surges)
- Consistent quality
- Supplier stability
- Can respond to actual demand changes faster

### 24.4.5.2 Mixed Model Scheduling

**Mixed Model:** Produce multiple products in same period (day/shift) in small batches.

**Example:**

**Traditional (Large Batches):**
- Monday-Tuesday: Product A (200 pcs)
- Wednesday: Product B (50 pcs)
- Thursday-Friday: Product C (150 pcs)

**Problem:**
- Long wait for Product C customer
- Large batch WIP
- Inflexible

**Heijunka (Mixed Model):**
- Daily production:
  - Product A: 40 pcs
  - Product B: 10 pcs
  - Product C: 30 pcs
- **Every day, all products**

**Benefits:**
- All products available daily
- Shorter lead time
- Can respond to changes
- Smaller batches (less WIP)

**Requires:**
- Quick changeover (SMED)
- Flexible workers
- Balanced operations

### 24.4.5.3 Heijunka Boxes

**Heijunka Box:** Visual scheduling tool for leveled production.

**Design:**
- Grid: Rows = products, Columns = time intervals
- Kanban cards placed in slots
- Workers take cards in sequence

**Example Box:**

| Product | 8:00 | 8:30 | 9:00 | 9:30 | 10:00 | ... |
|---------|------|------|------|------|-------|-----|
| A       | [K]  | [K]  |      | [K]  |       | ... |
| B       |      |      | [K]  |      | [K]   | ... |
| C       | [K]  |      |      | [K]  |       | ... |

- [K] = Kanban card
- Every 30 minutes (pitch), worker takes next card
- Card signals what to produce

**Benefits:**
- Visual schedule
- Level mix
- Easy to adjust
- Pitch-based production

## Summary

Just-In-Time (JIT) manufacturing produces the right part, in the right quantity, at the right time. JIT eliminates waste by producing only to customer demand (takt time), using continuous flow where possible and pull systems where flow isn't feasible. Production leveling (heijunka) smooths demand variation, enabling stable operations.

JIT requires quick changeovers, reliable equipment, capable processes, and supplier partnerships. While challenging to implement, JIT delivers significant benefits: reduced inventory, shorter lead times, improved quality, and increased flexibility.
