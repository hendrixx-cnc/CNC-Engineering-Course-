# Module 10 – Robotic Assembly Arm Systems

## 1. Introduction

Robotic arms automate complex tasks such as assembly, welding, painting, and material handling. CNC integration enables precise sequencing and synchronized motion.

## 2. Arm Types

- **Articulated arms**: Multiple rotary joints (e.g., 6-axis UR, Fanuc, ABB).
- **SCARA arms**: Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm for fast, planar operations.
- **Cartesian arms**: Linear axes for pick-and-place and gantry tasks.

## 3. End Effectors

- **Grippers**: Mechanical, pneumatic, magnetic for part handling.
- **Weld guns**: For automated welding stations.
- **Tool changers**: Enable multi-process automation.

## 4. Motion Control

- Servo motors drive each joint or axis.
- Encoders and resolvers provide feedback for position and speed.
- Teach pendant or offline programming for trajectory planning.

## 5. CNC & Robot Integration

- Coordinate via fieldbus (EtherCAT, ProfiNet) or digital IO.
- Synchronize robot and CNC axes for handoff or co-processing.
- Exchange signals for start, stop, error, and safety interlock.

## 6. Calibration & Programming

- Calibrate joint zero, tool offsets, and workspace.
- Use offline simulation for collision avoidance.
- Store programs and routines for repeatable jobs.

## 7. Safety

- Guarded workcell with interlocks and emergency stop.
- Light curtains and area scanners for human detection.
- Safety-rated PLCs for coordinated shutdown.

## 8. Maintenance

- Lubricate joints and inspect gearboxes.
- Replace worn cables, seals, and bearings.
- Check encoder alignment and update firmware.

## 9. Troubleshooting

- Position drift: recalibrate encoders and offsets.
- Joint errors: inspect servo drives and feedback.
- Communication faults: check fieldbus and IO wiring.

## 10. Conclusion

Robotic arms expand CNC capabilities into assembly, welding, and multi-process automation. Careful integration, programming, and maintenance ensure accurate and reliable operation.
