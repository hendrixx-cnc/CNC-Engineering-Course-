## O.5 Known Issues and Errata

### Current Open Issues (v2.0)

**Content Gaps:**
1. **Module 11 (Large FDM):** Needs more detail on gantry scaling challenges (targeted for v2.1)
2. **Module 12 (Hybrid Systems):** Limited manufacturer examples (pending partnerships)
3. **Appendix D:** Missing rack-and-pinion load calculations (complex topic, researching sources)

**Formatting Issues:**
- Some tables exceed 80-column width (causes wrapping in some Markdown viewers)
- Inconsistent heading capitalization in early modules (will standardize in v2.1)
- Math formulas: Considering switching from inline to block display for readability

**Reported Errors (Pending Verification):**
- Module 05, Section 5.8: Plasma torch height value may be incorrect (checking with Hypertherm)
- Appendix C: Servo motor frame size table (80mm frame power range overlaps 110mm, need clarification)

### Resolved Issues (Fixed in v2.0)

- ~~Module 03: Ball screw life formula had incorrect exponent~~ (Fixed Nov 2024)
- ~~Module 06: Missing coolant delivery section~~ (Added as Section 6.11)
- ~~Appendix B: Metric bolt torque table missing M16 data~~ (Added complete table)
- ~~Generic references throughout~~ (Replaced with 158 specific citations)
