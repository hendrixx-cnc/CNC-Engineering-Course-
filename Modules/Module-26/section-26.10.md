# Section 26.10 – Hiring and Managing Employees

## Overview

Transitioning from solo operator to employer is one of the most significant—and challenging—steps in growing a CNC business. Hiring your first employee fundamentally changes your business: you're now responsible for another person's livelihood, navigating employment laws, managing payroll, and learning to lead. Done well, employees multiply your capacity and enable growth. Done poorly, bad hires drain resources, create legal headaches, and cause endless stress.

This section covers when to hire your first employee, the complete hiring process, employment law compliance, compensation and benefits, onboarding and training, performance management, retention strategies, and handling terminations.

**Critical Reality:** Many technically excellent machinists struggle with people management. Managing people requires entirely different skills than machining parts. Be prepared to learn, make mistakes, and develop leadership capabilities.

## 10.1 When to Hire Your First Employee

Hiring too early strains cash flow and creates unnecessary overhead. Hiring too late costs you growth opportunities and burns you out. Getting the timing right is critical.

### 10.1.1 Can You Afford It?

**True Cost of an Employee:**

Many first-time employers underestimate the total cost. It's NOT just the wage.

**Total Employment Cost Breakdown:**

```
Base Wage: $20/hour × 2,080 hours/year = $41,600

Employer Taxes and Insurance:
  Social Security (6.2%): $2,579
  Medicare (1.45%): $603
  Federal Unemployment (FUTA, 0.6%): $250
  State Unemployment (SUTA, 3% avg): $1,248
  Workers Compensation (4% of wages, avg): $1,664
Subtotal Taxes/Insurance: $6,344 (15.3% of wages)

Benefits (if offered):
  Health insurance: $6,000-12,000/year
  Retirement match (3%): $1,248
  Paid time off (2 weeks): $1,600
  Holidays (6 days): $960
Subtotal Benefits: $9,808-15,808

Other Costs:
  Tools and PPE: $500/year
  Training: $500/year
  Hiring costs: $1,000 (amortized)
  Workspace/equipment: $500/year
Subtotal Other: $2,500

TOTAL ANNUAL COST: $60,252-66,252
Effective rate: $29-32/hour (45-60% above base wage)
```

**Rule of Thumb: True employment cost = 1.4-1.6× base wage**

**Monthly Cash Flow Impact:**

```
Monthly cost: $5,021-5,521
Can your business support this every month?
```

**Financial Readiness Checklist:**

- [ ] Revenue >$200K annually (indicates sufficient volume)
- [ ] Profitable for 3+ consecutive months
- [ ] Cash reserves: 6 months operating expenses PLUS 3 months payroll
- [ ] Predictable revenue (not one-time windfall)
- [ ] Can afford employee even if revenue drops 20%

**Cash Flow Test:**

```
Current monthly revenue: $_______
Current monthly expenses: $_______
Current monthly profit: $_______

With employee:
Additional monthly cost: $5,000-5,500
New monthly profit: $_______

Question: Is new profit still positive?
If yes, and you have cash reserves, financially ready.
If no or marginal, wait.
```

### 10.1.2 Do You Have Enough Work?

**Utilization Test:**

**Your Current Capacity:**
- 40 hours/week × 50 weeks = 2,000 hours/year
- Minus admin/quotes/sales (30%): 1,400 productive hours

**Are you using 80%+ of productive capacity?**
- 1,400 × 80% = 1,120 hours/year in production
- ~22 hours/week making chips

If yes, you're nearing capacity. If no, you have available capacity before needing help.

**Work Backlog:**
- Do you have 4-6+ weeks of backlog consistently?
- Are you turning down work due to capacity?
- Are lead times extending beyond customer expectations?

**Overtime Analysis:**
- Working 50-60+ hours/week consistently (3+ months)?
- Working weekends regularly?
- Declining quality or delivery due to overload?

**If answering "yes" to utilization AND backlog/overtime questions: You have enough work.**

### 10.1.3 Are You Ready to Manage?

**Management Skills Self-Assessment:**

Rate yourself honestly (1=poor, 5=excellent):

| Skill | Rating 1-5 |
|-------|------------|
| Communication (clear instructions, feedback) | ___ |
| Patience (teaching, dealing with mistakes) | ___ |
| Delegation (letting go of control) | ___ |
| Conflict resolution | ___ |
| Setting expectations and holding accountable | ___ |
| Providing constructive criticism | ___ |
| Motivating others | ___ |
| Time management (managing yours + employee's) | ___ |

**If most ratings 3+:** Ready to start learning management

**If most ratings 1-2:** Consider management training, mentorship, or delaying hire until you develop these skills

**Mindset Shifts Required:**

**From:** "I do everything myself (faster, better)"
**To:** "I train others and leverage their time"

**From:** "My way is the only way"
**To:** "Different approaches can work; teach principles, allow methods to vary"

**From:** "Perfection required"
**To:** "Good enough is acceptable; mistakes are learning opportunities"

**From:** "I control everything"
**To:** "I delegate and trust, verify results"

**Reality Check:**
Your first employee will:
- Make mistakes (lots of them)
- Work slower than you
- Do things differently than you'd do them
- Require significant training time
- Ask questions constantly

**If this thought fills you with anxiety and resistance, you may not be ready psychologically to hire.**

**When You're Ready:**
- Financial capacity (can afford employee)
- Work volume (have enough to keep them busy)
- Management willingness (ready to lead, teach, delegate)

**All three must be true. If even one is missing, wait.**

- Vague, non-specific answers
- Unprofessional demeanor
- Immediate availability from currently employed (why are they available immediately?)

**Advance 3-5 candidates to in-person interviews.**

**In-Person Interview:**

**Structure (60-90 minutes):**

1. **Introduction (5-10 min)**
   - Welcome, put at ease
   - Explain interview process
   - Brief company overview

2. **Behavioral Questions (20-30 min)**
   - Past behavior predicts future behavior
   - Use STAR format (Situation, Task, Action, Result)

**Example Behavioral Questions:**

- What types of materials have you machined? Which are most challenging?
- Explain how you'd approach a new job: customer provides drawing, now what?
- How do you determine speeds and feeds?
- What's your experience with inspection and measurement?
- Describe a typical setup process for you

**For Programmers:**
- What CAM software have you used?
- Walk me through your process for programming a new part
- How do you verify programs before running?
- What's your approach to optimizing cycle times?

**Look for:** Specific, detailed answers (not vague generalities)

4. **Shop Tour and Skills Assessment (15-20 min)**
   - Show candidate the shop
   - Observe: Do they ask questions? Show interest?
   - Give them a drawing: "How would you make this part?"
   - Show them a machine: "Walk me through how you'd set this up"

5. **Candidate Questions (10-15 min)**
   - Invite their questions
   - Good candidates ask about culture, expectations, growth, challenges
   - Lack of questions = lack of interest

6. **Close (5 min)**
   - Explain next steps
   - Timeline for decision
   - Thank them for their time

**Interview Red Flags:**
- Late without calling/explanation
- Unprofessional appearance (doesn't need suit, but clean, appropriate for shop)
- Can't answer basic technical questions
- Blames others for all past problems

**Options:**

**1. Paid Trial Shift (Recommended)**
- Hire candidate for 4-8 hours (paid)
- Assign real work under supervision
- Observe: skills, work ethic, safety, culture fit

**Example:**
```
"We'd like to bring you in for a paid 4-hour working interview.
You'll work on an actual job under my supervision. I'll evaluate
your setup, programming, and machining skills. You'll be paid
$20/hour for this time. Are you available this Friday?"
```

**Benefits:**
- See actual performance (not interview performance)
- Candidate experiences your shop
- Low-risk trial
- Legal (paid work)

**2. Skills Test (Unpaid, Short)**
- Give blueprint and material
- "Set up and make this part" (30-60 min max)
- Observe setup process, measurement, quality
- Don't use the part (if unpaid, can't benefit from their labor)

**3. Take-Home Exercise**
- Provide drawing: "Write a program for this part"
- Review program for correctness, efficiency
- Short (1-2 hours max, respect their time)

**What to Evaluate:**
- Technical competence (can they do the work?)
- Safety awareness (following procedures?)
- Problem-solving (how do they approach challenges?)
- Communication (asking questions appropriately?)
- Attention to detail (measurements, quality checks?)
- Speed and efficiency (realistic pace?)
- Cultural fit (work well with you and team?)

**Skills Test Best Practices:**
- Keep it short (respect candidate's time)
- Pay for working interviews (legally and ethically required if producing usable work)
- Give clear instructions
- Create consistent test across candidates (fair comparison)
- Observe, don't micromanage
- Provide feedback regardless of outcome

### 10.2.5 Reference Checks

**Why Reference Checks Matter:**
- Verify employment history
- Gain insights into work performance, reliability, character
- Identify red flags

**Who to Contact:**
- Previous supervisors (most valuable)
- Previous employers (HR for employment verification)
- Personal references (least valuable, always positive)

**What to Ask:**

**Employment Verification (HR):**
- Dates of employment
- Job title
- Eligible for rehire? (yes/no reveals a lot)

**Reference Interview (Former Supervisor):**

"Hi, I'm [name] from [company]. [Candidate] has applied for a machinist position with us and listed you as a reference. Do you have a few minutes to answer some questions?"

Questions:
1. What were [candidate]'s primary responsibilities?
2. How would you describe their technical skills and quality of work?
3. How was their attendance and reliability?
4. How did they handle feedback and criticism?
5. What were their strengths?
6. What areas could they improve?
7. Would you rehire them if the opportunity arose? (key question)
8. Is there anything else I should know?

**Red Flags:**
- Former employer won't give reference (policy excuse sometimes valid, but suspicious)
- Reluctance or hesitation answering "would you rehire?"
- Emphasis on weaknesses
- Vague, non-specific answers (trying to avoid saying negatives)

**Green Flags:**
- Enthusiastic recommendation
- Specific examples of good performance
- "Yes, absolutely" to rehire question
- Expresses regret they left

**Legal Note:**
Many companies have "policy" of only verifying employment dates/title (fear of lawsuits). Persist politely—many supervisors will provide reference off-the-record or if you ask specific questions.

## 10.3 Employment Laws and Compliance

### 10.3.1 Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)

**Federal law governing:**
- Minimum wage
- Overtime pay
- Recordkeeping
- Youth employment

**Minimum Wage:**
- Federal: $7.25/hour (as of 2024)
- State: Many states have higher minimums (CA $16, WA $16.28, etc.)
- You must pay the higher of federal or state

**Overtime:**
- Non-exempt employees: 1.5× regular rate for hours over 40 in workweek
- Workweek defined as 7 consecutive 24-hour periods

**Example:**
```
Employee works 48 hours in week
Regular rate: $20/hour
Overtime rate: $30/hour

Pay:
40 hours × $20 = $800
8 hours × $30 = $240
Total: $1,040
```

**Exempt vs. Non-Exempt:**

**Non-Exempt (Must pay overtime):**
- Hourly employees
- Most machinists, operators, technicians
- Default classification

**Exempt (No overtime required):**
- Salaried employees meeting specific tests:
  - Salary minimum: $684/week ($35,568/year) as of 2024
  - Duties test: Executive, administrative, or professional duties
- Most CNC shop employees are non-exempt (even if salaried)

**Common Mistake:**
Putting machinist on salary to "avoid overtime." **This doesn't work unless they meet exemption tests.** Machinists typically don't qualify for exemption.

**Recordkeeping Requirements:**
- Track hours worked (time cards, software)
- Maintain records 3 years
- Payroll records, rates, deductions

**Penalties for Violations:**
- Back pay owed
- Liquidated damages (equal to back pay)

### 10.3.5 Unemployment Insurance

**Unemployment Insurance:**
State and federal system providing benefits to unemployed workers.

**Employer Requirements:**
- Pay unemployment taxes (FUTA federal, SUTA state)
- File quarterly wage reports
- Respond to unemployment claims

**FUTA (Federal Unemployment Tax):**
- 6% on first $7,000 per employee
- Credit for state taxes (usually reduces to 0.6%)

- Tax on wage base (varies by state, $7,000-50,000+)

**Example (Georgia):**
```
New employer rate: 2.7%
Wage base: $9,500
Tax per employee: $9,500 × 2.7% = $257/year
```

**Unemployment Claims:**

**When employee files:**
1. State sends notice to you
2. You respond with employment details
3. State determines eligibility
4. If approved, state pays benefits
5. Your account charged, affects future rates

**Eligibility (Generally):**
- Terminated through no fault of own (laid off, position eliminated)
- Available and seeking work
- Meets wage/work requirements

**Ineligible (Generally):**
- Quit without good cause
- Fired for misconduct
- Refused suitable work

**Contesting Claims:**
If employee fired for cause, contest the claim:
- Document reason for termination
- Provide evidence (attendance records, performance docs, etc.)
- Attend hearing if required

**Best Practice:**
Document performance and conduct issues. If you terminate for cause, good documentation supports contesting unemployment.

## 10.4 Compensation and Benefits

### 10.4.1 Wage vs. Salary

**Hourly Wage:**
- Paid per hour worked
- Overtime required (1.5× over 40 hours)
- More common for production employees

**Salary:**
- Fixed amount per pay period
- May or may not be exempt from overtime (most machinists non-exempt)
- More predictable for budgeting

**For CNC Shop Employees:**
**Recommendation: Hourly** for machinists, operators, technicians
- Clearer (pay for hours worked)
- Avoids confusion about overtime
- Industry standard

**Salary** for office manager, sales, administrative (if exempt)

### 10.4.2 Overtime Requirements

**Overtime Basics:**
- Non-exempt employees: 1.5× for hours >40 in workweek
- Cannot waive overtime (even if employee agrees, must pay)
- Comp time not allowed in private sector (government only)

**Calculating Overtime with Shift Differentials or Bonuses:**

**Example:**
```
Employee regular rate: $20/hour
Night shift differential: +$2/hour
Works 48 hours (all on night shift)

Regular rate for overtime: $22/hour (includes differential)
Overtime rate: $22 × 1.5 = $33/hour

Pay:
40 hours × $22 = $880
8 hours × $33 = $264
Total: $1,144
```

**Managing Overtime:**
- Track hours carefully
- Require approval for overtime
- Cross-train to reduce dependency
- Plan workflow to minimize overtime

**Overtime is expensive (50% premium). Budget for it but manage tightly.**

### 10.4.3 Health Insurance

**Health Insurance:**
Not legally required for small businesses (<50 employees under ACA), but highly valued by employees.

**Options:**

**1. Group Health Insurance**
- Traditional employer-sponsored plan
- Employer pays portion (50-100%), employee pays rest
- Cost: $500-1,200/month per employee (employer portion)

**2. ICHRA (Individual Coverage HRA)**
- Reimburse employees for individual insurance premiums
- Flexible, employee chooses own plan
- Employer sets reimbursement amount

**3. QSEHRA (Qualified Small Employer HRA)**
- For employers <50 employees
- Reimburse medical expenses up to limit
- 2024 limit: $6,150 individual, $12,450 family

**4. Stipend (Not Recommended)**
- Pay employees extra to buy their own
- Not tax-advantaged (taxable income)
- Less attractive to employees

**5. No Benefits**
- Acceptable for startups, but harder to attract/retain employees
- Competitive disadvantage

**Recommendation for First Employee:**
- **Year 1:** Offer after 90-day probation, employer pays 50%, employee 50%
- Or: QSEHRA (reimburse $300-500/month toward their premiums)
- **As you grow:** Add richer benefits

**Typical Costs:**
- Single coverage: $600-900/month total ($300-450 employer share at 50%)
- Family coverage: $1,600-2,400/month total ($800-1,200 employer share)

**Annual employer cost per employee: $3,600-14,400 depending on coverage and contribution level**

### 10.4.4 Retirement Plans

**Retirement Benefits:**
Help attract and retain employees, provide tax benefits.

**Options for Small Employers:**

**1. SIMPLE IRA (Savings Incentive Match Plan)**

**For:** Employers <100 employees

**How It Works:**
- Employees contribute via payroll deduction (up to $16,000/year, 2024)
- Employer matches:
  - Option 1: Dollar-for-dollar up to 3% of compensation
  - Option 2: 2% non-elective contribution (all employees, regardless of contribution)

**Example (3% match):**
```
Employee salary: $45,000
Employee contributes: $3,000 (6.7%)
Employer matches: 3% = $1,350
Total contribution: $4,350
```

**Pros:**
- Simple administration (easier than 401k)
- Low cost
- Employees control investments

**Cons:**
- Lower contribution limits than 401k
- 2-year withdrawal penalty (if within 2 years of opening)
- Must offer to all eligible employees

**2. SEP IRA (Simplified Employee Pension)**

**For:** Any size employer

**How It Works:**
- Employer contributes only (employees don't contribute)
- Up to 25% of compensation, max $66,000 (2024)
- Must contribute same % to all eligible employees

**Example:**
```
Owner: $100,000 salary, contributes $25,000 (25%)
Employee: $45,000 salary, must contribute $11,250 (25%)

Total employer cost: $36,250
```

**Pros:**
- High contribution limits
- Very simple administration
- Flexible (contribute if profitable, skip if not)

**Cons:**
- Employer-only contributions (expensive if multiple employees)
- Same % required for all eligible employees

**3. 401(k)**

**How It Works:**
- Employees contribute via payroll deduction
- Employer may match (optional)
- Complex administration, higher costs

**Pros:**
- High contribution limits
- Flexible matching formulas
- Industry standard, expected by employees

**Cons:**
- Expensive to administer ($1,500-5,000+/year)
- Compliance testing required
- Complexity

**Recommendation for CNC Shops:**

**Solo or 2-3 employees:** SIMPLE IRA (easy, adequate)

**5+ employees:** Consider 401(k) (more attractive to employees)

**Typical Match:** 3% is standard and affordable.

**Annual cost per employee (3% match on $45K salary): $1,350**

### 10.4.5 Paid Time Off

**PTO (Paid Time Off):**
Combines vacation, sick time, personal days.

**Typical PTO Accrual:**

| Years of Service | Annual PTO |
|------------------|------------|
| Year 1 | 1 week (40 hours) |
| Year 2-4 | 2 weeks (80 hours) |
| Year 5+ | 3 weeks (120 hours) |

**Accrual Method:**

**Example (2 weeks = 80 hours/year):**
```
Accrual per pay period (bi-weekly, 26 periods):
80 hours ÷ 26 = 3.08 hours per pay period

After 6 months (13 pay periods):
3.08 × 13 = 40 hours available
```

**PTO Policies:**

**Key Decisions:**
- Accrual vs. lump sum (accrual better for startups—don't give all upfront)
- Use-it-or-lose-it vs. rollover (up to you, state laws vary)
- Payout at termination (required in some states)
- Waiting period (offer after 90 days or 1 year)

**Holidays:**

**Typical Small Shop Holidays (6-8 days):**
- New Year's Day
- Memorial Day
- Independence Day (July 4)
- Labor Day
- Thanksgiving
- Day after Thanksgiving
- Christmas Eve or Christmas Day
- (Optional: 2nd Christmas day, MLK Day, President's Day, Veterans Day)

**Cost of PTO + Holidays:**
```
Employee: $20/hour, 2 weeks PTO (80 hours) + 6 holidays (48 hours)
Total paid time off: 128 hours
Cost: 128 × $20 = $2,560/year per employee
```

### 10.4.6 Total Compensation Cost Calculation

**Fully Loaded Cost of Employee:**

```
Base Wage: $20/hour × 2,080 hours = $41,600

Payroll Taxes (15.3%): $6,365
Workers Comp (4%): $1,664
Health Insurance (employer share): $6,000
Retirement Match (3%): $1,248
PTO + Holidays (128 hours): $2,560

Total Annual Cost: $59,437
Effective Hourly Rate: $28.58/hour

OR: 1.43× base wage
```

**Use this fully-loaded rate when:**
- Calculating ROI on employee
- Determining billing rates
- Budgeting for hiring

## 10.5 Onboarding and Training

**Onboarding:** Process of integrating new employee into your business.

**First Day:**

**Paperwork:**

- Bi-weekly in months 2-3

**90-Day Review:**
- Formal performance review
- Assess: Skills, quality, reliability, culture fit
- Decision: Continue, terminate (end probation), or extend probation
- Adjust compensation if warranted

**Training Investment:**

**Reality:** First 3 months, employee is net-negative (cost more than they produce).

**Typical Productivity Curve:**
- Month 1: 20-30% productive (lots of training)
- Month 2: 40-60% productive (learning)
- Month 3: 60-80% productive (getting competent)
- Month 6: 80-90% productive
- Month 12+: 90-100% productive

**Budget for this training period.** You're investing in future productivity.

## 10.6 Performance Management

### 10.6.1 Setting Expectations

**Clear Expectations = Better Performance**

**Set expectations for:**
- Quality standards (tolerances, finish, inspection)
- Productivity (cycle times, setups, output)
- Attendance and punctuality
- Safety compliance
- Communication and initiative
- Professionalism and attitude

**How to Set:**
- Written job description
- Verbal communication (first day, first week)
- Demonstrate and model
- Reinforce regularly

**Measure and Track:**
- Quality: Scrap rate, rework, customer complaints
- Productivity: Parts per hour, setup time, machine utilization
- Attendance: Tardiness, absences

**Example Expectations:**

"As a CNC machinist here, I expect:
- Parts within tolerance 98%+ of the time
- Setup time <1 hour for standard jobs
- On time every day (7 AM start, no more than 2 tardies/month)
- Follow all safety procedures 100% of the time
- Communicate proactively (ask questions, report problems immediately)
- Take initiative (suggest improvements, solve problems)
- Professional attitude (respectful, positive, team player)"

### 10.6.2 Regular Reviews

**Formal Performance Reviews:**

**Frequency:**
- 90-day review (end of probation)
- Annual reviews thereafter
- More frequent for new/struggling employees

**Review Process:**

**1. Preparation:**
- Review employee performance data (quality, productivity, attendance)
- Note accomplishments and areas for improvement
- Prepare talking points

**2. Review Meeting (30-60 minutes):**
- Private, uninterrupted
- Review job responsibilities
- Discuss performance in each area:
  - What's going well (specific examples)
  - What needs improvement (specific examples)
- Employee self-assessment (ask their perspective)
- Set goals for next period
- Discuss compensation (if applicable)
- Invite questions and discussion

**3. Documentation:**
- Written review summary
- Both sign
- Keep in employee file

**Review Template:**

```

```

### 10.6.3 Addressing Performance Issues

**When performance issues arise, address promptly.**

**Progressive Discipline:**

**1. Verbal Coaching (Informal)**
- Pull employee aside privately
- Explain issue specifically
- Clarify expectation
- Ask for commitment to improve
- Document in your notes (not formal writeup)

**Example:**
"John, I noticed you've been late three times this week. Our start time is 7 AM, and I need you here on time so we can hit our production schedule. Can you commit to being on time going forward?"

**2. Written Warning (Formal)**
- If issue continues or is serious
- Document in writing:
  - Specific issue
  - Date/time/details
  - Previous coaching (if applicable)
  - Expected improvement
  - Consequences if no improvement
- Employee signs (signature = acknowledgment, not agreement)
- Keep in personnel file

**3. Final Warning**
- Issue continues despite written warning
- Clearly state: "This is a final warning. If [issue] happens again, you will be terminated."
- Document

**4. Termination**
- Issue continues or serious violation
- Terminate employment

**Common Mistake:**
Avoiding difficult conversations, hoping problems fix themselves. **They don't.** Address early and directly.

**Performance Improvement Plan (PIP):**

For serious but correctable issues:
- Define specific performance deficiencies
- Set measurable improvement goals
- Timeline (30-90 days typical)
- Support provided (training, coaching, resources)
- Consequences if not met (termination)

**Example PIP:**
```
Issue: Quality problems (3 scrapped jobs in 2 weeks, 15% scrap rate)

Goals:
- Zero scrapped jobs for 30 days
- Scrap rate <2%
- 100% first article inspection before production

Support:
- Daily review of setup and first article with supervisor
- Refresher training on inspection procedures

Timeline: 30 days (ending [date])

Consequence: If goals not met, employment will be terminated
```

### 10.6.4 Recognizing and Rewarding

**Recognition Drives Performance**

**Ways to Recognize:**
- **Verbal praise:** "Great job on that challenging setup, John."
- **Public recognition:** Acknowledge in team meeting (if you have team)
- **Written note:** Email or handwritten thank you
- **Bonus:** $50-500 spot bonus for exceptional work
- **Raise:** Annual merit increases
- **Responsibility:** Assign challenging projects, training others

**What to Recognize:**
- Exceptional quality (zero defects on challenging job)
- Initiative (suggested process improvement that worked)
- Problem-solving (figured out difficult setup)
- Going above and beyond (stayed late to finish rush job)
- Consistency (perfect attendance, reliable)

**Recognition Best Practices:**
- Specific (not generic "good job")
- Timely (soon after the accomplishment)
- Sincere (mean it)
- Consistent (recognize everyone's accomplishments, not favorites)
- Varied (not always the same person)

**Compensation Increases:**

**Annual Merit Raises:**
- Typical: 2-5% based on performance
- Tie to review (3% for meets expectations, 5% for exceeds)
- Budget 3-4% average across workforce

**Market Adjustments:**
- If you're underpaying relative to market, adjust
- Retain good employees by keeping pay competitive

**Bonuses:**
- Profit-sharing (% of annual profit distributed)
- Performance bonuses (hitting goals)
- Spot bonuses ($50-500 for specific accomplishments)

**Recognition Costs Less Than Replacement**

Replacing an employee costs:
- Recruiting: $500-2,000
- Training time: 3-6 months lost productivity
- Total: $5,000-20,000

Keeping good employee with $2,000 raise = bargain.

## 10.7 Employee Retention Strategies

**Why Retention Matters:**
- High turnover is expensive (recruiting, training costs)
- Disrupts operations
- Affects quality and customer service
- Lowers morale

**Turnover Costs:**
```
Losing CNC machinist making $45K:
- Recruiting: $1,000
- Training (3 months @ 50% productivity): $5,625
- Lost productivity until fully trained: $3,000
- Quality issues/scrap during learning: $1,000
Total: $10,625+ per turnover
```

**Retention Strategies:**

**1. Competitive Compensation**
- Pay market rate or better
- Regular raises (annual merit increases)
- Bonuses for performance

**2. Good Benefits**
- Health insurance
- Retirement match
- PTO and flexibility

**3. Good Management**
- Respect and treat well
- Listen and communicate
- Recognize and appreciate
- Provide feedback and coaching

**4. Growth Opportunities**
- Cross-training (mills, lathes, different processes)
- Advanced skills (programming, 5-axis, etc.)
- Responsibility increases
- Path to lead machinist or supervisor (eventually)

**5. Good Work Environment**
- Clean, safe shop
- Quality equipment and tools
- Reasonable hours (not constant overtime)
- Positive culture

**6. Job Security**
- Stable company, consistent work
- Transparent communication about business health
- Fair treatment

**7. Flexibility and Work-Life Balance**
- Reasonable on flexibility (appointments, family needs)
- Predictable schedule
- Not excessive overtime

**Employee Retention Survey:**

Annually, ask employees (anonymously if possible):
- Satisfaction with job (1-10)
- Satisfaction with compensation (1-10)
- Satisfaction with management (1-10)
- What do you like most about working here?
- What would you change?
- What would make you leave?

**Use feedback to improve.**

**Exit Interviews:**

When employee leaves, ask why:
- Where are they going?
- What prompted the search?
- What could have retained them?

**Learn and improve** to reduce future turnover.

## 10.8 Handling Terminations and Layoffs

**Termination Types:**

**1. Voluntary (Employee Quits)**
- Request 2 weeks notice
- Transition work
- Exit interview
- Process final paycheck (return tools, etc.)

**2. Involuntary - For Cause (Fired)**
- Performance issues
- Misconduct (theft, violence, harassment)
- Policy violations
- Document reasons
- Immediate termination typical

**3. Involuntary - Without Cause (Layoff)**
- Business downturn, lack of work
- Position elimination
- Not employee's fault
- Provide notice if possible (not legally required in most states)

**Termination Process (For Cause):**

**Preparation:**
- Review documentation (warnings, performance issues)
- Consult with attorney if uncertain
- Plan logistics:
  - When (early week, early day to allow employee to seek new job)
  - Where (private office)
  - Who present (you + witness if serious)
  - Final paycheck ready (required immediately in some states)
  - Retrieve company property (keys, tools, laptop, etc.)

**The Meeting:**
- Brief and professional
- State decision clearly: "We've decided to terminate your employment, effective immediately."
- State reason (if for cause): "As we discussed in your written warnings, [issue] continued and we're ending your employment."
- Don't argue or debate (decision is final)
- Explain final pay, benefits, return of property
- Escort employee to gather belongings and exit

**After Termination:**
- Secure facility (change codes/locks if necessary)
- Notify team (brief, professional, don't badmouth former employee)
- Process unemployment claim response

**Legal Considerations:**

**At-Will Employment:**
Most states are "at-will" meaning you can terminate anytime, for any reason (except illegal reasons).

**Illegal Reasons:**
- Discrimination (race, gender, age, religion, disability, etc.)
- Retaliation (for reporting safety issues, harassment, wage violations)
- Violation of public policy

**Documentation Protects You:**
If terminating for performance, document:
- Performance issues (specific incidents, dates)
- Coaching and warnings given
- Lack of improvement

**Protects against wrongful termination claims.**

**Unemployment Claims:**

**Employee Eligible If:**
- Laid off (no fault of their own)
- Fired without misconduct

**Employee Ineligible If:**
- Quit without good cause
- Fired for misconduct (serious violations)

**If Fired for Performance:**
Generally eligible (poor performance ≠ misconduct).

**If Fired for Misconduct:**
May be ineligible (contest claim with documentation).

**Severance:**

**Not legally required** (except Montana, specific contracts, or mass layoffs under WARN Act).

**When to Offer:**
- Layoffs (not employee's fault)
- Goodwill (long-term employee, position elimination)
- Release of claims (offer severance in exchange for waiver of legal claims)

**Typical Severance:**
1-2 weeks pay per year of service (negotiable).

## 10.9 Independent Contractors vs. Employees

**Independent Contractor:**
Self-employed person providing services.

**Employee:**
Works under your direction and control.

**Why It Matters:**
Misclassifying employees as contractors = IRS penalties, back taxes, fines.

**IRS Tests (Simplified):**

**Employee If:**
- You control HOW work is done (not just what)
- You provide tools and equipment
- Work exclusively or primarily for you
- Set schedule and hours
- Paid hourly or salary
- Ongoing relationship

**Independent Contractor If:**
- Controls how work is done
- Provides own tools
- Works for multiple clients
- Sets own schedule
- Paid per project
- Temporary engagement for specific project

**Example - Employee:**
Hire CNC machinist to work 40 hours/week, you provide machines and tools, you direct what jobs to run and how, ongoing employment.
= **EMPLOYEE**

**Example - Contractor:**
Hire CNC programmer on project basis to program specific job, they use their own computer and software, work from their location, you pay $500 per program, they have other clients.
= **CONTRACTOR**

**Common Mistake:**
Calling someone contractor to avoid payroll taxes. **IRS looks at facts, not titles.**

**Penalties for Misclassification:**
- Back payroll taxes (employer portion)
- Penalties and interest
- Back overtime pay
- Benefits owed
- IRS and state audits

**When in Doubt:**
Treat as employee. Safer and simpler.

**Legitimate Contractor Uses:**
- One-time specialized project (CAM programming, machine repair)
- Temporary capacity (2-week rush, hire contract machinist)
- Specialized services (accountant, attorney, IT support)

**Don't Use Contractors For:**
- Regular, ongoing production work
- Work that looks like employment (full-time hours, your facility, your control)

## Conclusion

Hiring and managing employees transforms your business from solo operation to scalable organization. It's challenging, requires new skills, and comes with legal obligations and financial commitments. But it's also essential for growth beyond your personal capacity.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Hire When Ready:** All three factors must align—financial capacity, sufficient work, and management readiness.

2. **Hiring Process Matters:** Invest time in job descriptions, thorough screening, skills testing, and reference checks. Bad hire costs far more than time spent hiring right.

3. **Compliance is Not Optional:** Employment laws (FLSA, EEO, OSHA, workers comp) have serious penalties. Understand and follow them, or hire HR help.

4. **Total Cost = 1.4-1.6× Wages:** Budget for fully-loaded cost (taxes, insurance, benefits, PTO) not just base wage.

5. **Training is Investment:** First 3-6 months, employee costs more than they produce. Budget for this training period.

6. **Clear Expectations and Communication:** Set clear expectations, provide regular feedback, address issues promptly.

7. **Recognition and Retention:** Keeping good employees is cheaper than replacing them. Pay fairly, treat well, provide growth opportunities.

8. **Document Everything:** Performance issues, warnings, training, incidents. Documentation protects you legally.

9. **Learn to Lead:** Managing people is a skill. You'll make mistakes—learn from them. Seek mentorship, read books, take courses on management.

10. **Contractors ≠ Employees:** Don't misclassify to avoid taxes. IRS penalties are severe.

**Your first employee is a major milestone. Prepare thoroughly, hire carefully, manage professionally, and you'll build a team that multiplies your capacity and enables sustainable growth.**
