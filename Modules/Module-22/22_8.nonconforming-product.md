# Module 22 – Quality Management Systems (QMS)


When products fail to meet specified requirements, systematic controls prevent unintended use or delivery. This section covers identification, segregation, disposition, and documentation of nonconforming products.

---

## 22.8.1 Identification and Segregation of Nonconforming Product

**Nonconforming Product**: Product that does not conform to specified requirements (dimensions out of tolerance, wrong material, damage, missing processes, etc.)

### Immediate Actions When Nonconformance Detected

**1. Stop Production** (if nonconformance could affect additional parts):
- Prevent producing more defective parts
- Investigate root cause before continuing

**2. Identify Nonconforming Product**:
- Tag or mark clearly: "NONCONFORMING", "REJECT", "HOLD"
- Red tags common (universal signal for reject)
- Include:
  - Part number and quantity
  - Description of nonconformance
  - Date discovered
  - Who identified

**Example Reject Tag**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⚠ NONCONFORMING PRODUCT ⚠          │
│ DO NOT USE - DO NOT SHIP            │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Part Number: 1234-5678              │
│ Quantity: 25 pcs                    │
│                                     │
│ Nonconformance:                     │
│ Hole diameter .505" (spec .500±.002)│
│                                     │
│ Discovered: 15-May-2024             │
│ By: J. Smith, Inspector             │
│                                     │
│ NCR Number: NCR-2024-042            │
│                                     │
│ Disposition: _____________          │
│ Approved By: _____________          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**3. Segregate Physically**:
- Move to designated nonconforming product area
- Separate from conforming product (prevent mix-up)
- **Bonded Cage/MRB Area**: Locked or controlled access area for rejects
- Do not release until disposition determined and approved

**4. Update Status** (if using ERP/MES system):
- Change lot status to "HOLD" or "REJECT" in system
- Prevents accidental shipment or use

### Segregation Methods

**Physical Barriers**:
- Separate room or caged area
- Red-marked floor area
- Dedicated shelving or racks

**Visual Identification**:
- Red tags attached to parts or containers
- Red bins or totes
- Warning signs ("NONCONFORMING PRODUCT AREA - DO NOT USE")

**System Controls**:
- ERP system status prevents transactions (picking, shipping)
- Barcode scanning rejects quarantined lots

---

## 22.8.2 Nonconformance Reporting (NCR) Process

**Nonconformance Report (NCR)**: Formal documentation of nonconformance

### When to Issue NCR

**Internal Nonconformances**:
- Parts rejected at inspection (in-process or final)
- Defects discovered during production
- Incorrect processes performed
- Material received not meeting specifications

**External Nonconformances**:
- Customer returns or complaints
- Defects discovered at customer location
- Field failures

**Thresholds**:
- Some organizations issue NCR for any reject
- Others only for significant issues (quantity, cost, recurrence)
- Define policy (e.g., "NCR required for rejects >$500 value or affecting critical characteristics")

### NCR Form Contents

**NCR Header**:
- NCR number (unique identifier, sequential)
- Date issued
- Issued by (name, department)
- Priority (critical, major, minor)

**Product Identification**:
- Part number and description
- Quantity affected
- Lot number, serial number, work order number
- Customer (if external)

**Nonconformance Description**:
- What is wrong? (specific, detailed)
- Where discovered? (operation, inspection stage, customer)
- How discovered? (inspection, testing, visual observation, customer complaint)
- Acceptance criteria (specification or requirement)
- Actual condition (measurement or observation)
- Photos or sketches (if helpful)

**Containment** (immediate action):
- What done immediately? (stopped production, segregated parts, notified customer)

**Disposition** (see Section 22.8.3):
- Scrap, rework, repair, use-as-is, return to supplier
- Disposition authority and approval

**Root Cause Analysis** (if performed):
- Why did nonconformance occur?
- Root cause findings

**Corrective Action** (if required):
- Actions to prevent recurrence
- Link to Corrective Action Report (CAR) if separate

**Closure**:
- Disposition completed
- Verification performed
- Closed by (signature, date)

### NCR Tracking

**NCR Log**:
- Register of all NCRs (spreadsheet or database)
- Enables trending and analysis

**NCR Log Fields**:
- NCR number
- Date opened
- Part number
- Nonconformance type (dimensional, material, damage, process)
- Disposition
- Status (open, awaiting disposition, closed)
- Date closed

**Reporting**:
- Monthly NCR summary (count, cost, trends)
- Pareto analysis (most common nonconformances)
- Review in management review meetings

---

## 22.8.3 Disposition Options

**Disposition**: Decision on what to do with nonconforming product

### Disposition Authority

**Material Review Board (MRB)**:
- Cross-functional team reviews nonconformances and determines disposition
- Members: Quality Manager, Engineering, Production, sometimes customer representative
- Formal meetings (weekly or as needed) or virtual approvals

**Disposition Approval Levels**:
- **Minor nonconformances**: Quality Manager or supervisor approval
- **Major nonconformances**: MRB approval
- **Critical/safety nonconformances**: Engineering and customer approval required

### Disposition Options

#### 1. Scrap

**Definition**: Part cannot be salvaged; discard

**When to Scrap**:
- Beyond economical repair
- Critical characteristic out of spec (safety, regulatory)
- Customer will not accept repair or use-as-is
- Material defect (wrong alloy, contamination)

**Process**:
- Document scrap decision on NCR
- Physically destroy or mark "SCRAP" (prevent accidental use)
- Remove from inventory (adjust quantities in ERP)
- Analyze scrap cost for metrics (scrap rate)
- Scrap material may have salvage value (sell to recycler)

**Example**: Titanium part with crack discovered during final inspection. Cannot be repaired (crack indicates material defect or process issue). **Disposition: Scrap**

#### 2. Rework

**Definition**: Bring product into full conformance with original requirements

**When to Rework**:
- Possible to correct defect and meet all original specs
- Economical (rework cost < scrap + replacement cost)

**Rework Approval**:
- Rework procedure must be approved (Engineering and Quality review)
- Defines rework steps, acceptance criteria, verification method

**Re-Inspection**:
- After rework, re-inspect per **original requirements** (full conformance required)
- If passes, release for use
- If fails, scrap or evaluate for repair

**Examples**:
- Dimension undersized → Cannot rework (cannot add material)
- Dimension oversized → Rework by machining to spec
- Missing hole → Rework by drilling hole
- Burrs or sharp edges → Rework by deburring
- Wrong coating → Strip and re-coat

**Rework Procedure** (example):
> **Rework Procedure for NCR-2024-042**
> Part: 1234-5678, Quantity: 10 pcs
> Nonconformance: Chamfer on hole missing
>
> Rework Steps:
> 1. Inspector verifies chamfer missing (visual inspection)
> 2. Operator uses chamfer tool (82° countersink, .020" depth) to add chamfer to each hole
> 3. Inspector verifies chamfer per drawing (visual and depth check)
> 4. If OK, remove reject tag and release to stock
> 5. If not OK, scrap part
>
> Approved: Engineering _______ Quality _______

#### 3. Repair

**Definition**: Alter product to meet intended use, but **not** to original requirements

**Key Difference from Rework**:
- **Rework**: Brings to full original specification
- **Repair**: Alters to alternative specification acceptable for use

**When to Repair**:
- Cannot meet original spec, but alternative acceptable
- Economical
- Customer agrees (concession required)

**Approval Required**:
- Engineering evaluates if repair acceptable (fit, form, function, safety)
- Customer approval (deviation or concession)
- Document deviation in NCR and on part/record

**Re-Inspection After Repair**:
- Inspect to **repair specification** (not original drawing)
- Document that part repaired per approved deviation

**Examples**:
- Hole diameter .505" (spec .500±.002"): Repair by boring to .520" and installing oversized bushing (customer approves Engineering Change)
- Surface finish rougher than spec: Repair by additional grinding to improve finish (may not meet original Ra, but acceptable to customer)

**Important**: Repair requires customer notification and approval (concession, deviation, or engineering change). Without approval, cannot ship repaired parts.

#### 4. Use-As-Is

**Definition**: Accept product without correction, even though it does not meet original requirements

**When Use-As-Is**:
- Nonconformance minor and does not affect fit, form, function, safety
- Customer agrees nonconformance acceptable
- Economical (avoid scrapping usable parts)

**Approval Required**:
- Engineering evaluates impact
- Customer approval (concession or waiver)
- Document justification

**Examples**:
- Cosmetic defect (scratch on non-visible surface): Use-as-is if function unaffected
- Dimension slightly out of spec but still functions: Engineering analysis shows acceptable, customer approves
- Missing non-critical marking: Use-as-is if marking not required for traceability

**Use-As-Is vs. Repair**:
- **Use-As-Is**: No changes made to product (ship as-is)
- **Repair**: Product altered before shipment

**Customer Communication**:
- Notify customer of nonconformance
- Request concession or waiver
- Document approval in NCR
- Ship with notation (e.g., "Shipped per customer waiver dated 20-May-2024")

#### 5. Return to Supplier

**Definition**: Nonconforming purchased material or service returned to supplier

**When Applicable**:
- Material or purchased parts received nonconforming
- Outside process (heat treatment, plating) defective

**Process**:
- Document nonconformance (NCR or Supplier Corrective Action Request - SCAR)
- Notify supplier
- Obtain Return Material Authorization (RMA) from supplier
- Return for credit, replacement, or rework by supplier

**Example**: Aluminum bar stock received with diameter 1.985" (spec 2.000"±.010"). **Disposition: Return to supplier for credit and replacement.**

#### 6. Sort/Segregate

**Definition**: Inspect 100% to separate conforming from nonconforming (when sample inspection detects defects)

**When Applicable**:
- Sample inspection rejected lot
- Portion of lot may be conforming

**Process**:
- 100% inspect all parts in lot
- Segregate good (conforming) from bad (nonconforming)
- Release conforming parts
- Disposition nonconforming parts separately (scrap, rework, etc.)

**Example**: Sample inspection found 3 defective parts in sample of 50 from lot of 500. **Disposition: 100% sort remaining 450 parts, separate good from bad.**

## 22.8.4 Material Review Board (MRB)

### MRB Purpose

**Material Review Board (MRB)**: Cross-functional team that reviews nonconformances and determines disposition

**Benefits**:
- Multiple perspectives (quality, engineering, production)
- Consistent dispositions
- Ensures decisions technically sound and economical
- Customer representation (for critical customers/applications)

### MRB Membership

**Typical MRB Members**:
- **Quality Manager** (chair)
- **Engineering Manager or Lead Engineer**
- **Production Manager or Supervisor**
- **Purchasing** (for supplier issues)
- **Customer Representative** (aerospace, medical often require customer participation)

**Quorum**: Minimum members required for valid decisions (e.g., Quality + Engineering minimum)

### MRB Process

**1. NCR Submitted to MRB**:
- NCR issued by Quality or Inspector
- Nonconforming product segregated
- NCR forwarded to MRB for disposition

**2. MRB Reviews NCR**:
- Review nonconformance details
- Evaluate options (scrap, rework, repair, use-as-is)
- Consider:
  - Technical feasibility (can it be reworked? Will repair work?)
  - Safety and function (does defect affect performance?)
  - Cost (scrap vs. rework cost)
  - Customer requirements (will customer accept?)
  - Schedule impact (time to rework vs. scrap and remake)

**3. MRB Determines Disposition**:
- Decide on disposition (scrap, rework, repair, use-as-is)
- Document decision on NCR
- Approve rework/repair procedure (if applicable)
- Identify if customer concession required

**4. MRB Approvals**:
- MRB members sign NCR approving disposition
- If customer concession required, obtain before proceeding

**5. Execute Disposition**:
- Production or Quality executes disposition (scrap, rework parts)
- Re-inspect if reworked/repaired

**6. Close NCR**:
- Verify disposition completed
- Update NCR status to closed

### MRB Meeting Frequency

**Options**:
- **Scheduled Meetings**: Weekly or bi-weekly MRB meetings to review all open NCRs
- **As-Needed**: MRB convenes when significant NCR arises (for critical issues requiring immediate decision)
- **Virtual/Electronic**: MRB reviews and approves NCRs via email or electronic workflow (no formal meeting)

**Best Practice**: Combination approach
- Routine NCRs: Electronic review and approval (fast turnaround)
- Complex or critical NCRs: In-person MRB meeting (discussion and collaboration)

## 22.8.5 Rework and Repair Procedures

### Rework Procedures

**Rework Procedure Requirements**:
- Document steps to correct nonconformance
- Specify tools, equipment, methods
- Define acceptance criteria (original requirements)
- Identify verification method (re-inspection)
- Approve before execution (Engineering and Quality)

**Rework Procedure Template**:

```
REWORK PROCEDURE
NCR Number: ____________
Part Number: ____________  Quantity: ______

Nonconformance: [Description]

Rework Steps:
1. [Step 1 with details]
2. [Step 2]
3. [...]

Acceptance Criteria: [Original drawing requirements]

Verification Method: [Re-inspection method and tools]

Rework Performed By: ____________ Date: ______

Re-Inspection Results: ☐ Accept  ☐ Reject

Inspector: ____________ Date: ______

Approved By:
Engineering: ____________ Date: ______
Quality: ____________ Date: ______
```

**Re-Inspection After Rework**:
- Must meet **all original requirements** (no compromise)
- Use same inspection methods as original
- If passes, release
- If fails, scrap (further rework usually not economical; indicates rework procedure inadequate)

### Repair Procedures

**Repair Procedure Requirements**:
- Document altered specification (repair standard)
- Engineering analysis shows repair acceptable (fit, form, function maintained)
- Customer concession obtained (formal approval)
- Define verification method (inspect to repair standard, not original)

**Customer Concession Process**:
1. Engineering prepares concession request:
   - Describe nonconformance
   - Propose repair
   - Justify acceptability (analysis, testing, experience)
2. Submit to customer for approval
3. Customer reviews and approves or rejects
4. Document approval on NCR
5. Proceed with repair per approved procedure

**Tracking Repairs**:
- Parts repaired should be identifiable (serial number, lot number)
- Traceability: Link repaired parts to NCR and customer concession
- If performance issues later, can trace back to repair

---

## 22.8.6 Customer Notification and Approval

### When Customer Notification Required

**Notify Customer When**:
- Nonconforming product already shipped
- Nonconforming product requires repair or use-as-is disposition (concession needed)
- Delivery delayed due to nonconformance (scrapped lot, need to reproduce)
- Safety or regulatory concern
- Customer contract specifies notification (e.g., "Notify customer within 24 hours of any nonconformance affecting delivered product")

**Do Not Wait**:
- Notify promptly (within 24-48 hours)
- Delayed notification damages trust and may allow customer to use defective parts

### Notification Content

**What to Include**:
- Description of nonconformance (part number, quantity, defect)
- Impact assessment (safety, function, performance)
- Parts affected (lot numbers, serial numbers, delivery dates)
- Proposed disposition (repair, return, use-as-is)
- Request for approval (if concession needed)
- Corrective action to prevent recurrence (if known)

**Communication Methods**:
- Email (common, provides documentation)
- Phone call followed by written confirmation
- Formal letter (for serious issues)
- Customer portal or system (if available)

### Customer Concession Request

**Concession/Waiver/Deviation**: Customer approval to accept nonconforming product

**Concession Request Format**:

```
CONCESSION REQUEST

To: XYZ Manufacturing, Attn: Quality Manager
From: ABC Machining, Quality Manager
Date: 20-May-2024

## 22.8.7 Traceability of Nonconforming Material

### Why Traceability Matters

**Scenario**: Nonconformance discovered after parts used in production or shipped

**Need to Answer**:
- Which specific parts affected?
- Where are they now? (stock, in-process, shipped to customer)
- What jobs or assemblies used affected material?

**Traceability Enables**:
- Targeted containment (isolate affected parts, not entire inventory)
- Customer notification (identify which customers received affected parts)
- Recall (if necessary)

### Traceability Methods

**Lot/Batch Tracking**:
- Group of parts produced together (same date, machine, setup, material heat lot)
- Lot number links parts to production records, material certifications, inspection results

**Serial Number Tracking**:
- Unique identifier for each part
- Enables tracking of individual part (where it went, what assembly it's in)
- Required for aerospace, medical, automotive (critical parts)

**Material Heat Lot Traceability**:
- Link finished parts to material heat lot
- If material defect found (wrong alloy, contamination), can identify all parts from that heat lot

**Traveler/Router**:
- Job tracking document follows part through manufacturing
- Records operations, inspections, nonconformances
- Retained for traceability

**ERP/MES System**:
- Electronic tracking of lots, serial numbers, genealogy
- Enables rapid queries ("Which jobs used material from heat lot H-123456?")

### Nonconformance Traceability Example

**Scenario**: Heat treatment found out-of-spec for Lot 2024-0515 (hardness too low)

**Traceability Investigation**:
1. **Identify affected parts**: Lot 2024-0515 = 100 parts, part number 1234-5678
2. **Check disposition**:
   - 25 pcs in finished goods stock (quarantine immediately)
   - 50 pcs shipped to Customer A on 10-May (notify customer)
   - 25 pcs shipped to Customer B on 12-May (notify customer)
3. **Containment**:
   - Quarantine stock (25 pcs)
   - Notify customers (provide lot number, serial numbers if available)
   - Request customers inspect and quarantine
4. **Disposition**:
   - Engineering evaluates: Low hardness = reduced strength, safety concern
   - Disposition: Scrap (cannot use-as-is for safety-critical application)
5. **Customer Actions**:
   - Customer A: 50 pcs not yet used, return to supplier
   - Customer B: 25 pcs already installed in assemblies, customer disassembles and replaces
6. **Corrective Action**: Investigate heat treatment process, implement controls to prevent recurrence

**Without Traceability**: Would not know where parts went, cannot contain issue, risk of failures in field

---

## Summary

Nonconforming product control ensures defective parts are identified, segregated, and properly dispositioned to prevent unintended use or delivery. Nonconformance Reports (NCRs) document defects and disposition decisions. The Material Review Board (MRB) provides cross-functional review for consistent, technically sound dispositions. Options include scrap, rework (to original spec), repair (to altered spec with customer approval), or use-as-is (customer concession). Customer notification and approval required when nonconformances affect shipped product or require concessions. Traceability enables targeted containment and recall when defects discovered after shipment.

Effective nonconforming product control protects customers, reduces risk, and drives corrective action to prevent recurrence.

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Complete an NCR

Create a Nonconformance Report for a scenario:
1. Define nonconformance (dimensional defect, wrong material, damage, etc.)
2. Complete NCR form with:
   - Product identification
   - Nonconformance description
   - Containment actions
   - Disposition (with justification)
   - Approvals
3. Determine if customer notification required

### Exercise 2: MRB Disposition Decision

Scenario: Final inspection found 20 parts with hole diameter .505" (spec .500±.002"). Cost: $50/part material and labor.

MRB Review:
1. Identify disposition options (scrap, rework, repair, use-as-is)
2. For each option, evaluate:
   - Feasibility (can it be done?)
   - Cost (estimate)
   - Time (impact to delivery)
   - Customer acceptance
3. Recommend disposition with justification
4. Determine if customer approval needed

### Exercise 3: Write Rework Procedure

For a nonconformance (missing chamfer, rough surface finish, burrs, etc.):
1. Write rework procedure with:
   - Steps to correct defect
   - Tools and methods
   - Acceptance criteria (original spec)
